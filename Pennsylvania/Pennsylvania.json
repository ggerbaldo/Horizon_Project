She finally seated us, which began a wait of another 20 minutes for a server and only after stopping the ineffective hostess for help did someone finally arrive after another 5 minutes.  We ordered and were promised bread right away.  1 hour and 10 minutes after we were seated the bread arrived and 15 minutes later the entrees arrived.  Meanwhile some customers arrived, were served and left. Our entrees were fairly good, but our mood was of total frustration and disappointment.  This place is totally disorganized and lacks management.  The hostess is clueless, unemotional and not welcoming at all.  Servers are hurried and stressed.  There are additional help (busboys?) running around taking direction from servers, but still everyone is ineffective and not a speck of teamwork in the building.

A mixed brink from the bar and asked for a coke. While this was going on,  we have been waiting for our food which we ordered already for a HOUR !!! A HOUR!!!! Mind you they weren't busy at all.  Everyone around us was waiting and getting pissed. My Bf said give it 2 more minutes,  I was ready to go purse in hand. We ordered fish and chips and shrimp scampi pasta nothing special, and even charge for the bread that they give you,  other Restaurants it's FREE.  That's was the best part of the dinner the bread.  Fish and chips were the worst I ever tasted, the oil was old first off,  the breading was nasty what ever it was,  and it was cold.  Shrimp scampi pasta with 6 shrimp Luke warm had no taste.  So the 1 star is because I had to,  to be able to write this. So don't even waste your time or money.

Immediately after sitting, we heard a loud  disturbing pounding sound above our heads, like someone aggressively jumping rope or hammering?! It was intermittent, but enough to be truly distracting. When I mentioned this to our server, she laughingly said, \"they must be tenderizing the meat and should be done soon.\" She did not offer to move us. The jumping\/hammering continued for most of our meal.\n\nWe ordered drinks, including a \"Hurricane\" which was a special for the evening. After some time, the Hurricane and few lackluster beers came out. The Hurricane was absolutely disgusting, like a rancid grapefruit with too much sugar. It was sent back and another drink was ordered, which took a full ten minutes to arrive, but was at least consumable. We ordered our appetizers and entrees.\n\nThe Crab and Artichoke dip was very watery, and rather bland for what is usually an easy home run of a combination. The Calamari was rubbery from overcooking, (a classic blunder) and over-breaded. Additionally, some parts of the Calamari tasted a bit fishy to me, which is not a good sign. They did not provide us with any plates, which we had to ask for.\n\nOn the positive, the best thing I ate there (by far) was the Clam Chowder. Our entrees, though overpriced, were mostly good. One of our party ordered a full rack of ribs, which was over-peppered (to the point of her choking at points) but very tender (must have been that incessant banging overhead throughout our entire meal?!). The \"all you can eat mussels\" were decent. When one of our parties' salads arrived, it was literally just a halved head of iceberg lettuce sprinkled with bacon bits and blue cheese? I stared for a full thirty seconds in disbelief watching her attempt to saw into it.\n\nThe service was a bit awkward and slow, and our waitress seemed not to comprehend that we needed more than one container at the end to hold the large portion of ribs? The restaurant remained mostly empty while we were there.\n\nLastly, though the entrees were decent, we felt this meal was vastly overpriced for the food and service that was rendered.","gmap_id":"0x89c6c252d2bcebe7:0x5385c090c06a8d16","fecha":"29\/04\/2016"}

They were clearly stressed because big boss man was in the store for inventory day. My review of this store is not a reflection on the guy making my breakfast. He deserves 5 stars. Royal Farms, as an organization, is trying to compete in a market saturated with one primary competitor, and they must consider going to a simpler set of options. Sheetz has the same problem. Too many options and a poorly designed system to provide those options. All those options add chaos and disorder to the behind-the-counter setup.\n\nBeen in and out of this store a few times over its lifetime and it hasn't really improved.","gmap_id":"0x89c6c3b19ac211cb:0x8922dc8d3a864452","fecha":"03\/02\/2021"}

We ordered two drinks. One was an oat latte and my husband got a caramel macchiato. The oat latte tasted burnt. I don\u2019t know what brand oat milk they use, but it made the drink taste horrible. I was surprised with it being their featured drink. My husband was satisfied with his drink. We also ordered 2 blueberry muffins, but the inside of the blueberry muffins were under cooked and had gooey batter in the middle. Our kids had 2 hot chocolates and 2 funfetty donuts which they enjoyed. When we got to the window to get our order they asked what we had ordered. We explained again. The owner had jumped in because it seemed like there system wasnt working right. He handed us a random order that was not even ours and then took it back. Under the circumstances with COVID-19, I pray they didnt give it to the next person in line and remade it. It not very considerate under the circumstances of COVID to just hand random orders into cars, if you are not sure, if it is theirs or not. I know this place is new and they are trying to find their rhythm, but we were not impressed. I am definitely gonna give them another chance, but our first impression was not good.","gmap_id":"0x89c6e9f53a39460f:0xbb2b90a665cee027","fecha":"07\/02\/2021"}

The tofusada could quite possibly be the best tofu I have ever eaten, and I really appreciate the vegan options. The manager or owner came outside to ask us how everything turned out. I could tell the staff was stressed because they were very busy and only opened a few days ago, but quality was 110%.

The only complaint I can think of is one evening I stopped in, the black beans looked awful and crusty. I assume they were to be rotated out soon but idk. Their burritos slap tho, especially cause they mix it before folding and make fresh tortillas. Definitely worth a try imo.","gmap_id":"0x89c6e9bec7a6d581:0xa72eb8b596c21063","fecha":"28\/05\/2021"}

This was my very first visit to this restaurant. If Chipotle and Moe's had a kid it would look like this place. They make the burrito shell at the time you place the order. The staff is friendly and the food was great. If I had walked out at this point I would have left this review a 6 stars (if that were possible), But I ate there. The drink selection is poor the lids and straws are against the wall and my short wife could not reach. The benches have no cushion and they nickel and dime you for things their competition gives away for free. It's not a bad place to eat but with Chipotle, Moe's and Qdoba all in the area I don't see myself returning anytime soon.","gmap_id":"0x89c6e9bec7a6d581:0xa72eb8b596c21063","fecha":"09\/04\/2021"}

The food the deli thinks is ok to serve to human beings is DISGUSTING. Sometimes genuinely inedible. Wawa makes it SO easy to make hoagies. They LITERALLY list every ingredient in the EXACT ORDER it's supposed to go in. They are super strict on amount of slices of meat, cheese, amount of mayo, etc. Therefore, there is absolutely no excuse for the weird, creepy things on rolls I've been given that they want to try and call a hoagie. It almost seems like these people are putting EFFORT into making the food they sell inedible. One time I received an italian hoagie so gross I had to spit it out. Lettuce just swimming in a pile of mayo. Literally looked like they hand tossed the lettuce and mayo to make a disgusting slushy mess. That day I decided I clearly can't trust them to be making sandwiches clearly but it is still the most convenient lunch spot close to my work and I have very little time to grab lunch so I thought I would just play it safe and get a meatball sub next time. That's a safe bet, right? You cant mess that up, right? WRONG. I took a photo it was so unbelievable. They ACTUALLY put 2 dry meatballs on a roll with 1 piece of cheese and called it a day. The sauce that IS on there looks like an accident and not a part of the sandwich. Now, besides how gross the food is the staff IS SO RUDE! I once got in a shouting match with a worker named Dylan behind the deli because he was loudly discussing how he shouldn't have to pay child support because \"he sees his kid.\" His coworkers were clearly upset and uncomfortable and so was everyone waiting for their food! I made a comment to let him know everyone (about 10-15 people in front of the deli waiting for the food at the lunch rush) was uncomfortable and it was pissing people off and he returned back YELLING AT ME. It wasn't until I told the manager I was going to call corporate that she sighed and said \"Ugh, Dylan could you stop?\". He was YELLING AT A CUSTOMER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DELI WHILE EVERYONE WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO MAKE THEIR FOOD. When I left eve I now go to Leo's Steak Shop 1 block down. You should too. Don't waste your money or time like I did way too many times.","gmap_id":"0x89c6c3a54d3ccf6f:0xa549fd76ca1d6f57","fecha":"24\/03\/2018"}

Sauce is one of the most important things in most dishes so I'm very happy their's has great flavor, isn't watery at all, and has a little extra kick to it. Honestly their sauce is one of the best I've tasted in all of PA - please keep up the good work. The sausage in my dish was also crispy which is the best way to have it over the al dente pasta they served. Service wise they were OK, but I would have gotten desert if they were a bit faster. The portion size was about what I'd expect for each meal and bread was included on the table with some peppers. Meals cost around $20 with some being a tad more and others being a tad less. In the warmer months you can also sit outside which is a nice plus. Overall I'd highly recommend them as this is one of the best Italian places I've eaten at in PA.","gmap_id":"0x89c6e907df5c8371:0x43f2249b4afb329e","fecha":"15\/12\/2019"}

Our server brought mine out last and told me, \"I'm so sorry. They are remaking your order and I brought this (seemed to be the egg white omelette) out for you now.\" Despite my family prompting me to eat it, I didn't touch it because it wasn't what I wanted.\n\nEveryone else ate, and were almost done, and our server brought me a salmon frittata (someone else in our party ordered one, but I don't eat fish.) I took it back to her and said that I ordered the carne frittata, and I didn't even want it now because the rest of my party had finished their meal. She came back a few minutes later with the carne frittata!!!  (The table behind us witnessed all of this had already left.)\n\nI reminded her that I said I didn't even want it, since everyone else was done eating (and I was really fed up at this point.) We asked for a manager and were told there wasn't one on duty. They chef was handling things.\n\nOur server was very polite and apologetic, offered dessert (which I declined) and then took our coffees off the order.

The food is where the true beauty lies. I've been here about a dozen times and I've had an exceptional meal, every time. You can't go wrong with any of their classic nor original dishes.  If you're lucky enough to make it here on a Sunday, try the Braciola: it's an 8oz NY strip steak pounded thin, rolled up with asparagus, sun dried tomatoes and some cheeses and cooked in a delicious sauce. 5 stars for food! Awesome! Their beer list here is short, but their cocktail list is lovely. 4 stars for their liquids. The service here is hit or miss.

So what is so special about this Wawa?\nIt's not a Super Wawa and it doesn't have gas pumps yet, for me, this is my favorite Wawa location, at the corner of Ashland Ave and MacDade Blvd.\nThe staff and management should be commended for the fast, friendly customer service that they provide. They excell in all that they do. All employees and managers have each others backs and when there is a crunch, it's all hands on deck. No matter what, the employees are jovial, helpful and friendly toward all.\nI stop in this Wawa location almost every day to get coffee, milk and on occasion, sandwiches or treats. If you are looking for a breakfast sandwich that isn't available on the shelf, they will make one for you. If you want to alter the regular breakfast sandwich ingredients, no problem, they will make one for you. Nothing is too much trouble for them to accomplish for a customer.\nThe other thing I notice about this location; the customers are almost as nice as the Wawa staff. People hold doors for each other and say thank you when something has been done for them that isn't required. The customers here seem to me, to appreciate the working staff and each other. Many are \"regulars\". I'm sure that, through the course of the day, things aren't always smooth sailing, but it sure seems that way whenever I visit the store.\nI have been in other Wawa's in the area and they also do a great job but I find this particular location to be just a cut above the rest.\nI hope the Wawa Main Office recognizes that this is a very special location, made so buy the employees who serve here. Thank you folks who labor for my business. You make me want to shop here, that's how good you are!","gmap_id":"0x89c6c3b21867990f:0x83b7baa38672bc0","fecha":"30\/04\/2019"}

I placed a mobile order for curbside pickup, just in case. Sure enough, after 10 minutes pass after me being charged, the app says \"Thanks for coming hope you enjoy your food,\" which I found curious, as I was empty-handed. I sent my girlfriend into the store to retrieve the order 5 minutes later, assuming that 15 minutes and being given the clear from the app was more than enough to believe my 2 sandwiches and single beverage were finished. Lo and behold, another 10-15 minutes later, (half an hour after my money had been taken) I end up entering the building myself to see what's going on. Once inside, I spent the next 15 minutes watching several people (about\/at least 7 parties) get served before me, all completely disaffected with their own wait time being more than 10 minutes, myself 45 minutes in at this point. After hearing the crew reminded of my order about 6 times, watching the sun go down completely, the location empty out completely TWICE, and observing a full shift change, some absolute saint of what I'm assuming to be a manager, decided to take down our order and make it for us, and promised some free fries for the wait. Allegedly the store never even saw the order, but the app has a plethora of issues I've experienced before so that was believable enough. I'd love to say that's when an upswing in our experience started, but of course the sh*tshow isn't close to over. The sandwiches came out rather quickly, but 10 minutes AFTER that we received our shake(s). Our sandwiches ended up not only lukewarm at best by the time we got out of our HOUR LONG TRIP TO MCDONALDS FOR THREE ITEMS, not only was one SMOTHERED with mustard to the point of being a sloppy, inedible mess that we ultimately threw out, not only was the other sandwich missing an extra beef patty that I was charged $2 for, but we weren't given any fries as promised, and were instead given, without consultation, a second shamrock shake, which might've been suitable if one of us didn't absolutely despise mint. Believe me, I understand issues with the app, but that excuse can only carry you through about 2 sentences of this review, the rest falls on a far too careless staff. I will not be returning as a customer, nor will I accept delivery orders from there as a courier for DoorDash, GrubHub, and UberEats, as I value my time and my jobs too much to put up with anything near this ridiculous of an experience again, especially at the risk of being blamed by one of my customers for the location's absolute incompetence.","gmap_id":"0x89c6e88736416af7:0x522ed12320833c3e","fecha":"28\/02\/2019"}

Been treated like that a number of visits to the Brookhaven PA McDonald's on Route 352 Edgmont Avenue in Brookhaven PA.\nAnother time I was at the drive thru for 15 minutes and still did not get my vanilla ice cream cone and they Tryed to over charge me for it. They never came back to the window to give me my ice cream cone. I left getting nothing.\nManagers are responsible and are not doing their job there. They need to find people that are responsible to do their job to serve the customer.\nI will have to try a store 5 miles away instead of a mile that has better employees and managers that care about their customers. It is not worth the gas to drive that far because another store does not do their job right.\nI use to go at least 2 times a week and stopped as to many problems not getting what I ask for. I have had a single burger that was suppose to be a double hamburger. I have had cheese and onions put on my burger when I did not want them. Employees do not listen even after repeating my order.

The food was Fabulous i had the Chicken Nero two beautiful, tender, juicy pieces of blackened Chicken over fire grilled Vegetables. Serving sizes are huge but im definitely not upset to have leftovers. Price Wow definitely would have paid much more. Now the service and staff to me this is important  you can go anywhere and eat, but to go somewhere and eat and still have the feeling of home and family is not something you find often. Christine was our server she was excellent, explained the menu , brought our food and drinks promptly and engaged in small talk. The staff in the back Johnny and Chris yous killed it food was excellent from the taste, temp to presentation. We will definitely be back!

We usually use a Insta Pot and cook whole roasts in an hour or less but we opted to follow directions in the slow cooker setting at 10 hours.\n\nServing was 2 bowls and change as the package stated. The meat seamed more just your regular flank steak fajita meat and not so much brisket.  After 10 hours it was still a tad chewy but nothing to really complain about. Definitely not the brisket we were expecting\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t to say that it didn\u2019t taste great. In fact we couldn\u2019t stop commenting on how flavorful and zesty it tasted.  Even went back for the little bit of seconds that was left however there was no meat left to be had. We used our own bag of cauliflower rice instead of the regular rice it came with so it was just that and the broth with fliggles of peppers left.\n\nIs it worth $30? I\u2019m not so sure. I understand you pay for convenience but for what you get $15 a serving might be a little steep for a bowl.\n\nWe love supporting local businesses and plan on trying other meals and options.","gmap_id":"0x89c6e8872118e0a9:0x2d0120696075f98","fecha":"29\/03\/2021"}

They were also very Bland. The mild sauce had absolutely no heat. And hardly any flavor. The wings, I think , were boiled first. Because they had no flavor. Like they were cooked out of it.

I have ordered from here serval times but this time was horrible . So I ordered over the phone and paid for my food. The delivery was fast but when I got my food some of it was undercooked and the other just didn\u2019t look edible. I quickly called and the young lady was talking to what appears to be the owner and he says well I can\u2019t send a driver back out so I can give you a discount on the next order I then say well I can\u2019t eat this so you can just refund me. He says ok well you can reorder but I have to change the delivery fee which is 3.50 which I didn\u2019t mind but it got weird when the reorder was only 12.00 and my previous order was 26.00 after taxes And delivery fee so food was about 15.00 and he still wanted To charge me even more. The young lady understood what I was saying and explained to him that and that\u2019s when he finally agreed after I told her he can just deduct the delivery charge and refund me or I can call my bank. I don\u2019t see why you would want to make things difficult when all I wanted was edible food. Not to mention they are literally 3 mins from my house. It wasn\u2019t even avoid the fee cause I was willing to pay that it\u2019s the fact that I told you the food isn\u2019t edible and you think I\u2019m suppose to take that loss. I will not be ordering here anymore. And he wants the old food back and I said that\u2019s fine I didn\u2019t want it anyway. Like I can\u2019t eat it duh or I wouldn\u2019t be in this situation. It\u2019s covid 19 and y\u2019all want food back instead of the trash.. this only makes me concerned more because why would I want to order from a place in covid 19 who wants food back and that\u2019s possibly contaminated.","gmap_id":"0x89c6c3ee3d139db3:0x94ef6ff843f1680f","fecha":"28\/07\/2020"}

I called about it and the girl I talked to, after a round of 20 questions, said that he didn't mention it. Of course he isn't going too tell you that he screwed up. She said that I will get a refund.

I guess now I know too. However it was awful wasting all of those sandwiches!","gmap_id":"0x89c6e9a83e2e2bb7:0x9524d611ed19481e","fecha":"31\/08\/2017"}

There is a nice long bar on one side and a raised seating area on the other. Very cool decor all around with a ton of local character. 5 stars for ambiance!\nThe food here is fantastic and they have some really great specials such as a burger+ a beer for $6.(I wish I went to college and had a bar nearby that had deals like that!) 5 stars for the edibles!\nAwesome tap list! They have a great selection always with local brews when they can get them(slim pickins'). Certainly 5 stars for liquids!\nService: Whilst I've scored 5 stars for each category up to this point, I must end by talking about the service you'll get here. It's the epitome of world-class. There haven't been words invented yet to describe how friendly the bartenders are here.(I'm mainly talking about Chris but they're all great.) So since there are no words I'll just say 6 stars for service. Since Google is on a five star rating system, I must limit this rating to five stars.\nThanks, Maggie May. You're the best in Chester.

One of the sandwiches I purchased was an egg, sausage and cheese muffin.\n\nAs shown in the photos, the top bun was smaller than usual. It appeared to have 3 bite marks or was pealed off. Confused, I turned the sandwich around only to find nearly a 3rd of the bottom bun broken\/bitten off. Let's just say more things came out my mouth that morning than went in.\n\nUnfortunately, I only discovered the sandwich in this condition after I drove off to work. It was too late to turn back. I was pretty upset and did not feel comfortable eating it. I couldn't return until around 1pm.\n\nI was directed to the manager who was tried to convince me this was \"normal\" and happens when they make the sandwiches. She claimed the muffin \"tears\" when they split the sandwiches. While explained that I understand muffins cannot be split perfectly in half, what I received was not normal as much of the muffin was broken\/bitten off. Even if it wasn't bitten off, I shouldn't have to question whether or not it was. I made it clear that I have been purchasing sizzlis for years and have never had this experience. I had to show her the sandwich again just in case she missed it. 1\/3rd of the muffin was gone. It wasn't normal.\n\nShe asked what I would like her to do. I then asked for a replacement if possible. She mumbled something under her breath as she passed me, something to the effect of \"i can't believe this\". Then went to the back to bring out a muffin and noted that \"it's going to end up torn in the same way\" and repeated that phrase or something similar a couple times before actually tearing the sandwich as if she wanted it to be torn unevenly as pictured.\n\nIt felt very condescending - it was like a scene out of a reality TV show.  Truely, bizarre. The muffin she split turned out to be perfectly fine. She disappeared in the back without saying a word. I had to only assume she made the sandwich. She was very dismissive and did not bare me any attention. Fortunately, my patience paid off without me having to interrupt the manager again. Within 5 or so minutes, one of the employees in the back preparing food gave me the sandwich and I was on my way.\n\nBased on prior experiences at other Wawa locations, I expected a smooth correction to the issue I encountered. Instead, I was met with a manager who I felt was unnecessarily rude and devalued my experience as a frequent customer. Hopefully, both this sandwich and the experience with a Wawa manager was a one time issue. Though, next time, I'd rather deal with the partially eaten sandwich than with the manager with a less than impartial attitude.","gmap_id":"0x89c6e976646def67:0x946d85e191a11b95","fecha":"07\/11\/2019"}

I came here with a friend on a Friday night.\n\nWe ordered the Roasted Vegetable Flat Bread to start, and the Salmon and Tofu for our main courses. The Flat Bread came out quickly and tasted OK, it only came on white bread but the Roasted Veggies were tasty (It came with a \"fig pesto\" which was almost invisible to the palate).\n\nAfter this small plate is where the restaurant went south for us: Our main dishes took roughly 40 minutes to come out (about 5 water refills worth). When we received our meals they were over-seasoned (with salt and pepper, no less) and generally under-whelming. The Tofu drew comparisons to scrambled eggs doused with salt and pepper and the Salmon was very salty.  It's really hard to critique the rest of the plate when the featured portion was so disappointing. I ate about 1\/3 of the Tofu dish and rejected the rest.\n\nIt would have been nice to get an apology for the length of time it took to get our main dishes but we didn't. Pretending the service wasn't bad or not recognizing that I didn't even finish half of my main dish doesn't make things better, that goes for any restaurant. You definitely could tell it was an inexperienced establishment still trying to figure itself out (the atmosphere wasn't quite there and somewhat amateur).\n\nI was especially disappointed because I had such high expectations: its philosophy was admirable and the previous ratings were exceptionally high. Maybe I'll give it another chance with the Summer Menu... just so long as tofu isn't the featured portion.","gmap_id":"0x89c6e90627b3f849:0x75399265effd9942","fecha":"02\/06\/2012"}

Ordered one piece of sausage pizza, one double cheeseburger with fries, one order of 4 chicken strips and a diet soda.\n\nEstimated delivery time was 7:45. By 8, nothing, so I called the restaurant.\n\nA man with an Indian accent answered. When I told him my situation he just kept saying\/yelling \"It's already out it's already out.\" Then hung up. I called back. I was like, did you seriously just hang up on me? I want to know WHEN I can expect my food? He just kept repeating it's out, it's out. So I asked to speak to a manager. He said he WAS the manager, so I said forget it, I'll take it up with GrubHub.\n\nI contacted GrubHub and THEY contacted the restaurant and got the same nonsense. The guy said the food had gone out 10 minutes ago, and that was that. I told them that if I got cold food, I would be demanding a refund.\n\nAt 8:45 my food finally showed up. I told the delivery guy I wasn't pleased, and he actually said he had noted it was an hour late before leaving. I told him that I'd spoken to the manager on the phone who said the food had already left for delivery 10 minutes ago...and that was half an hour ago.\n\nThe delivery guy said there was no manager in. I told him I spoke to the guy with the accent, and the delivery guy said that was the same guy to whom he pointed out how late the food was, to which he was told \"I don't cook the food!\"\n\nOnce I got my food inside - they forgot the soda - the food was all cold and on top of that, DISGUSTING. I've attached a photo of the piece of pizza for reference. It is clearly just an old stale piece of pizza from earlier in the day, and they threw a handful of cheese on top that barely melted before sending it out.\n\nI contacted GrubHub and asked for a refund, and they contacted the restaurant, who refused the refund. So I've filed a chargeback complaint with my bank.\n\nIf you have a choice between this place or eating a handful of broken glass, the choice is easy.","gmap_id":"0x89c6e7c2771e4b2f:0x1f07e995c0f7bb26","fecha":"16\/01\/2017"}

Food was cold. Delivery to Folsom - 75 minutes. Order wrong. Literally someone else's order. Options were to come pick up our order or wait for them to deliver it again. Finally, last night which was ridiculous. Delivery to Folsom - After 105 minutes ... that's right ... and hour and 45 freaking minutes ... she called. It hadn't left yet. How long does the food sit there? They asked if we wanted to come pick it up and they'd wave the delivery charge! How noble of you! I told my wife to tell them to shove it. My wife must like their food and asked how long it would be and was told about 45 minutes. So, 2 HOURS TO FOLSOM. Takes me 7 minutes to drive there.

Domino\u2019s customer care left the decision with the franchise owner which again is very lame.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to write but again I don\u2019t want and sorry that because of one person the whole store and hard working people there have to read this. Again my intention is to ensure the store take such matter with at most seriousness.","gmap_id":"0x89c6e887372e055d:0x4da4bb379b675cd","fecha":"22\/12\/2019"}

After about an hour, the tracker updated to show that the pizza had been delivered.

I know this is impossible because I haven't changed my number in over two years and I order from the app often. He offered to get the manager and left the line open, so I could hear background noise from the store. I sat waiting for another 5 minutes before I hung up and called back.\n\nI was finally informed that I would not receive my pizza tonight. The only positive was that the manager was friendly and courteous.

I did not find out my order was NEVER delivered until the next morning (which to clarify, my order was for my 2 children and Grandmother who was at my home while I went away for the evening to a Superbowl party in Maryland).. I am upset because my card was still charged and no one from the restaurant notified me of my delivery not being successful. Communication is key. It is now day 3 of me calling to receive my refund and being told to keep calling back, I will no longer call I will contact their coporate office and go above the \"managers\" head since he's still sick from partying all night on Superbowl sunday ( which is what was explained to me)..

I ordered it 40 mins early (12:24) because I\u2019ve learned to never expect anything on time from Dominos. I have a set amount of time I can take a lunch, and even then I\u2019m usually called to do something. My lunch is at 1. I called after an hour (1:23) and was told my food was out for delivery. Another hour or so later (2:16-2:36) and after being hung up on, my food was found in the back, not out for delivery. I said I didn\u2019t want to pay for this. After nearly 3 hours (3:16), I was delivered warm food and still have a charge on my card. No apology. No accountability. Nothing. It was as if it was my fault my food wasn\u2019t delivered on time.\n\nThe excuse I was given is the delivery driver was having car troubles. So I was lied to twice before that, over the phone. If I was told this to begin with, I would have picked it up when I was able to clock out. It wouldn\u2019t have escalated to this. Not only did the deceit piss me off, but as a manager, if your driver has a car issue like that, you need to get in your car and make your deliveries. Be proactive and have good customer service skills. If my car breaks down on my way to work, I\u2019m expected to still be in on time and do my job. It\u2019s inexcusable.\n\nI also called and emailed cooperate and got nothing, no phone calls or emails in return. not an apology or some way to make this right. I don\u2019t understand why Dominos has so many issues and why this seems to be a reoccurring issue across the board. Someone needs to stand up and be accountable for their mistakes. Communication is important in having a successful business.

They found something about each caller to make fun of.  Sometimes even calling them idiots after hanging up the phone.  Sometimes they make faces into the phone.  If there is an error in the order, it is the customer's fault and not their own.  This ALWAYS happens here.  It's kind of strange to go to a restaurant where they are so consistently rude, especially during a recession!  You'd think a place like this would love getting business.  I rarely even get a \"thank you\" from them.\n\nOn the other hand, their hoagies are really good and the hot peppers are probably the best I've ever had.  I mean, really good.  I have an unhealthy passion for hoagies and, judging by food quality alone, this place is easily in my top 3 of all time, putting Slacks behind Sarcone's and Primo's.\n\nSo, I'm really torn on this place. Maybe I should just channel Seinfeld, consider them Hoagie \"Nazis\", put up with it.","gmap_id":"0x89c6c23e6d5da4a1:0xda5ad327ba9dca01","fecha":"09\/12\/2009"}

Always loved any of their salads, especially the house salad. The last 3 were skimpy. They stopped adding black olives, mushrooms, green peppers  very disappointed. So I did not order the salad last night. Instead, ordered the crab cake platter which is always fabulous. Not this time. The crab cakes were so over fried that I had to use a knife to cut them. So over crunchy. The fries were so undercooked  I had to put them in our toaster oven to finish cooking them. Don't give them a huge order, cause they always seem to miss giving you part of your order.  The Cole slaw was good. They haven't found a way to ruin that yet. If they don't get with the program we will never order ever again. Not when there's Pat's right up the street.

It has a prime location and could do really well if it invested in some market research and had a chef come up with a better pie. There is nothing special about the pie at all, sadly. I don't mean to offend the business owners, but I am rather trying to be honest and helpful. It is not good. One of things would be to set the crust apart from what is generic and typical in the area and spice up the sauce some. Anyway, here's hoping that one day I could order a Walt's Pizza Pie and start referring others. My review is solely based on the pizza. The wonders that could happen if this place stepped it up on the pies.\n\nFor points of reference, the best pizza places are as follows in no particular order: Leandro's Pizza House (mmm good), Imperial (awesome crust), Cocco's (ask for lighter cooked), Sciarrino's (only the one in Darby; it is hole in the wall, but real tasty), Gaetano's (amazing sauce!!! crust needs adjusting) and Johnny's Pizza (tasty pie place in Prospect Park). Maybe the owners can visit these place and see what is going on. My two cents for whatever it is worth.

Both times I ordered the same thing, the hamburger deluxe platter with fries. The first time, the burger was fresh but not even warm. And this time the burger and fries was horrible. The burger was room temp, I could feed it to a baby, and flavorless, the tomatoes were soggy. Half of my fries were burnt, and as a whole, they were room temp as well. I'm surprised because we had the food delivered and it came pretty fast for it to have been delivered. So I would have thought that my food would have atleast been warm.

There was a misunderstanding about my order. I called and in the process of resolving the issue the call disconnected. A hang up, perhaps? The platter I ordered was disheveled it appears as if the food was thrown on the container. The muffins weren't uninformed as they were with my first order. Overall I was displeased. The service and disheveled appearance of my food gives me the impression the chef is moody. The woman that answers the phone whom, I believe hung up on me is moody too. I do business with professionals. I'm sorry their service isn't up to my standard. I tried.\nUpdate 3\/26\/18\nI have this establishment several more tries and my family and friends have also.  The fish I recently ordered had an unpleasant odor. The chicken my family member ordered was overly salted. We literally poured oil of the mac'n cheese.  I received a piece of extremely oily garlic bread,  it was disgusting. Everything is placed on top of aluminum foil, in a Styrofoam container.  Have these folks read how both these materials are hazardous to health? In addition to foods with too much p oil and sodium.  In addition to these things if they are not enough,  the availability of the delivery service is subpar. I feel certain this owner can hire another part time driver to handle the calls this business gets when the regular driver is out. No, he simply states delivery isn't available when his flyer, says delivery and pick up. This is unprofessional. Also I'm certain he could hire someone to clean the windows and glass door. The lack of delivery service and unclean windows and doors definitely conveys the message this owner doesn't care how he is seen by those\nthat patronize him.
