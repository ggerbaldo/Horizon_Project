They kept taking my fork after clearing each course,  but never replaced it when food came back. So strange.   They need to figure our if they are a relaxed neighborhood spot or more fine dining. Salads were the best thing we ordered.  Garlic bread tastes like it has garlic powder sprinkled on it, calimari is ok.  Pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, but sauces were a miss. Eggplant parmesan was one huge under seasoned, under done slab of eggplant. Puttenesca was so watery. Tasted like it was just a jar of olives, brine and all. Too one dimensional. The Fra diavolo sauce was too spicey but also just not good.  I wish they wild give you an option of pastas when ordering. I wish I had gotten spaghetti instead of penne. Ambiance was nice, but I think food needs improvement. And that's coming from an East coast Italian American.

This has been billed as a big portions\/take leftovers home kinda place and it was not that for us at all. My spaghetti and meatballs were tasty but they were also $16 and I left hungry. My husband left so hungry he had to grab food on the way home. Maybe we're just bigger eaters, but we've never had to do that before after a pasta dinner. This was by far the biggest negative for us.\n2)Garlic bread was meh and still cold in the middle. Some plain, tasty bread for the table would go a long way here.\n3)No kids menu. We thought we'd be ok sharing our plates with our carb-loving toddler (anticipating big portions) but were instead doling out bites to her from our not so generous pasta portions. My meatballs were very tasty and dialed in for the adult pallette but pepper flakes made them a no go for the 2 year old. Kids menu would help this, especially for a restaurant geared to kids and families.\n\nIn short, if you're a lighter eater and\/or not trying to take kids to dinner here, it could still be a good spot for you. If Red Sauce increases portion sizes and makes it easier to bring kids here, we would love to come back.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7b89ba5673a3:0x9daf7128a81f9ada"}

{"user_id":1.084539196e+20,"name":"Robert Fox","rating":3,"text":"My search of Denver for great barbecue continues. I'm starting to feel like Diogenes, stalking the streets of Athens with his lamp (I can't remember, was he also looking for barbecue?). Alas, SmokeHouse17 fails to be the place that satisfies my desires.\n\nThe space is small, but very attractive in a rustic way, with a nice bar, counter ordering, a reasonable amount of inside seating, and a patio with several picnic tables. The main focus of the bar is barrel-aged and specialty cocktails. The wine and beer selection is very limited. The menu features locally-sourced, all natural meats.\n\nI tried the Wagyu brisket, the pulled pork, and the pork ribs with sides of green chili mac & cheese, bourbon baked beans, and cole slaw. I also tried both sauces. The brisket was very tender, but tasteless. The pulled pork was tender and reasonably juicy, but also had very little flavor. The ribs were tender, but dry and tasteless. I could not detect a smoke ring on any of the meats.\n\nThe mac & cheese was the highlight of the meal; very cheesy and well-seasoned. The cole slaw was also seasoned properly. The beans were terrible: tasteless, tough, and watery. I finished with the banana pudding. It was OK, although a bit gummy in spots.\n\nThe staff was pleasant and helpful and the food came out fairly quickly. The sauces were good, but barbecue should stand on its own. I had to drown the meats in sauce to get any flavor out of them. I never do this. I was also annoyed when I got home to find that the containers of sauce were not even half full and that the cold items had been intermingled with the hot dishes. An overall disappointment.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7982e77cfb3d:0x939fcc70d9c2a0a5"}

The scallops themselves were quite overcooked and full of sand . The panang curry lacked flavor completely. While the brown rice was good, both the steamed and fried rice were mushy and tasteless.  As a matter of fact, the fried rice was a beige blob!  The chicken satay was extremely dry and the peanut sauce was anything but peanut sauce.  Fried tilapia was incredibly dry.  The fired bananas were an utter disappointment.  But the worst was, my favorite, Tom Kha  This Tom Kha soup was extremely watery, with nothing but raw onion slices in it.

I was taking my daughter out for a celebration and made a reservation at Mila referred to as a sister restaurant by Limelight supper club. When we arrived I needed to use the bathroom so after we were seated I went and when I came back I asked my daughter if the waiter had been by yet, and she said ya just for some water. So 10 minutes go by and I actually had to get up and ask the hostess where our waiter was (which is a huge pet peeve of mine, especially with fine dining). Then the waiter casually comes up with his arms all tattooed (unprofessional for a high end restaurant in my opinion), and says \"I already talked to your daughter about this\" I was like \"What, now this guy is arguing with me\"! this really upset me. Then the food was good but not exceptionally good probably because the service was so bad it ruined it for the food for me.  I had to get up a second time to get our waiter when I had told him we wanted to order dessert and he said ok and never came back! We had a show we needed to be at the performing arts center so we were on a schedule, I did set aside 2 hours for a nice dinner. During the times I was waiting and looking for our waiter, I noticed him dilly dallying most of the time behind the bar with the patrons over there! So as we are leaving the hostess comes up and says \" I know the service was sub par but would like to invite you back and give you these coupons for a free cocktail the next time you come in\" I said well thats nice of you but we don't drink. So she puts the coupons back in her drawer and says \"well I hope you come visit us again anyways\" I was like wow they couldn't offer something else like the price of those drinks off the bill we just paid which was over $100 for 2 people no alcohol. When a place is that expensive and fancy I have high standards which Mila failed miserably at. The hostess also was not dressed very nice nor was the waiter, nor were they trained for a fine dining experience, they were more suited to be running a Denny's or the \"Denver Diner\". My advice, train your staff to give the experience of fine dining that you are charging for and why people come to your restaurant otherwise lower your prices a lot & turn Mila into a diner. There are way better places to go in downtown Denver for a fine dining experience such as Rioja.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c78d988400001:0x92405530b80c7a75"}

We were disappointed by the food. The chicken in the chicken Korma was very tough and chewy. The waiter didn't clarify if we wanted white or dark meat, and I didn't remember to specify, so I'm okay with them defaulting to white meat. But as I mentioned, the meat was not tender. The sauce tasted a little off to me. The naan was also hard to chew. As a side note, the bathroom was nice and warm and very clean. They had music videos playing with the latest Bollywood music, which was an interesting change from the more traditional music played at other Indian restaurants. Overall, I would like to give this place a try again. Hopefully if we get another dish, it will be better.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c78d7e15911ab:0xdc775011d0399943"}

The sauces are great and generally every bowl has been great. When we first started dining the root bowl was an incredible mix of vegetables and super filling. Each subsequent visit the bowls became more sauce and rice and less everything else to the point yesterday after recommending our group order from here our veggie bowls were just sauce on quinoa and nothing else. Fortunately the meat bowls looked wayyy better.     So stick to the meat, skip the root options and you'll be fine.

When I arrived the employees were just sitting around eating food in the dining area and it looked to be food from another restaurant.. Not a good first impression. I then ordered the food and that process was good enough but the food that came out was in HUGE portions. It seems that White Fence Farm did 0 market research about the neighborhood and thought they could bring family size portions to a part of the city that is young and childless. The food wasn't much better. As many other reviewers have commented the chicken was very oily and my french fries weren't very good. They were soggy with oil I couldn't even eat them. I think KFC has better chicken then what I got tonight.

You went for the food, as well as the experience of the entire place: the gift shops, etc. This fast food type version of White Fence Farm just doesn't cut it.\n\nService was poor, and there were only two parties ahead of us, both of which had ordered, and were waiting for their order. One party had two people, the other party was a single person. There isn't much to any order, as the menu is basic, such as 4 pieces of chicken, two sides, and some corn fritters. The food is already prepared in the kitchen, all they have to do is serve it up, so more like fast food, rather than the table service and experience that you get at the original White Fence Farm. When we were brought our order, it was correct. The only thing is, there was no extra plate or basket type thing for my husband (or I) to use to put our chicken and sides on.  I went up to the counter and asked for a plate or something to put my food on. The girl said, \"Oh yeah,\" and handed me a paper plate. It's not a hard concept, two people, two plates. I don't get it.\n\nFood quality - I will admit that the sides, especially the mac and cheese, as well as the mashed potatoes, are good. The chicken pieces that you get are very small.\n\nInterior - clean, which is nice to see, and open. Lots of windows, so if it's cold outside, bring a sweater to wear inside. There are not a lot of tables \/ seating. I still believe that management would like people to order for take out, rather than sit inside. It's ok to sit inside, but you would be more comfortable sitting at your own kitchen table.\n\nNoise Level - Quiet, as there are very few customers inside, bummer.\n\nWith the popularity of the originality of White Fence Farm, I would expect this smaller version of the original restaurant to be busy. Every time we have walked by, there are only a few people, if any, in the restaurant. The restaurant has been opened since mid November, 2016. I'm not sure if they are going to make it. Another nearby store also serves fried chicken, and it's actually quite good, and I think better than White Fence Farm. Disappointing.

The food here is of much higher quality than other buffets, always fresh, and delicious. They also have sushi, and while it doesn't reach \"Sushi Restaurant\" status, it's not bad, I actually don't even touch the sushi in any other buffets but here. Service has always been good, simple and respectful staff. The establishment is roomy and nicer than most.\n\nIf you want a great BUFFET experience, check them out.

None have been bad enough to boycott the place, but none have been good enough to rave about it either.  Some items are fresher than others and I would highly recommend going during busy hours, like any buffet.  The service is ok, but they never seem to smile or be happy. Sometimes I wonder if they are forced to work there, like some of the kids that you will often see working.\n\nThere are lots of food options, a salad bar, desert\/fruit area, a sushi bar, seafood dishes at night, and even some American dishes like pizza and french fries mixed in for the kiddos.  I feel like even though everything isn't super fresh always, there are enough items to choose from that you can find something fresh enough to make a meal out of.  I usually like the chicken and mushroom, jalapeno chicken, cheese wontons, and a spicy all white meat chicken dish that I can't think of the name right now (honey chicken maybe?).\n\nThe prices are affordable, too.  Around $10 for lunch and around $15 for dinner. That's what you would pay for a meal anywhere, so I think that's reasonable for an all-you-can eat buffet offering sushi and seafood.\n\nOverall the place is worth stopping when you're craving some Chinese food and don't want to wait, however, don't expect over the top freshness, service or cleanliness.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c76f5140c1fe1:0xafdbf478a6090dca"}

Black Eye Cap Hill is open 7:00 am to 5:00 pm.\nWe thought we would give White Lies a try. We have tried Black Eye Cap Hill.\n\nThe facility for both restaurants is in the same location.\nThis review is for White Lies.\n\nThe lights are dimmed, and the music is a soft jazz, very nice. You can actually hear the other people in your party, which I like. There are approximately 6 booths, and several long community tables, with attached stool type backless seats. There is also a bar with seating as well.\n\nThe dinner menu is limited. We choose the Hanger Steak, with mashed potatoes and asparagus.\nThe Hanger Steak was good, cooked to the requested temperature. The asparagus was good, as were the mashed potatoes. The price of the Hanger Steak was $17, a bit pricey, but it was good, nothing to complain about.\n\nWaiter service was good, but the majority of the other tables (with younger patrons) did get better service. When I'm in a restaurant, I like to observe other people, as well as the restaurant employees. The food service was a bit slow. Considering the restaurant was not that crowded, it was a surprise.\n\nParking - street parking, which isn't that bad, as the location is just east of Lincoln, so that helps. You may still have to park at a parking meter.\n\nThere are lots of windows in the facility, so, perhaps bring a sweater, which I noticed several other patrons had on sweaters, or light weight jackets.  Spring isn't here yet in Denver, so you know how that goes.\n\nI'm thinking that both Black Eye Cap Hill, as well as White Lies, are both targeting the younger crowd, and there is nothing wrong with that. Also, I think they are targeting the \"come, have a drink, or two, and stay for a while, have an appetizer too,\" crowd. Both being places \"to be seen.\" This is not my type of thing, as I'm past that stage in my life, and that's ok.\n\nSo, all in all, White Lies is not a bad place, it's just not my place.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7ed7eff22ccd:0x8364ff019603b578"}

Not every pizza we make is perfect, but i promise you we try. Since we use a sourdough crust,  it can sometimes bubble up causing spots where it might seem like there was no sauce or cheese but really it just got cooked extra. I understand if you don\u2019t give us a second chance but i always like to try a place twice to make sure it wasnt just a fluke if i had a bad first experience. But please come by for a pizza on us and hopefully this time you think it\u2019s better than below cafeteria quality.

{"user_id":1.165946198e+20,"name":"Ryan Hicks","rating":1,"text":"I don't really understand the hype about this place. I ordered the Mr. Pink Pizza from uber eats last night and it has salami, red sauce, and mozzarella. While it wasn't the worst pizza I've had in my life it most definitely wasn't worth the $16 bucks and $21.27 total from ordering it off uber eats. It was highly over priced. While the uber eats experience was great the presentation, taste, and experience of this pizza didn't match the uber eats experience nor the other reviews posted here.\n\nAs you can see from the images it arrived with a pool of mozzarella and red sauce that wasn't sticking to the crust. It was just floating on it. And as you can also see from the 2nd image all the ingredients were sliding off the crust every time I picked up a piece to eat. The crust is thin and has no flavor to it. It has a strong 5-grain wheat flour taste to it. Unless I get a free pizza I don't see myself trying this place again; every one of their pizzas is either $16 or hovers around that price. I'm not even terribly picky on my pizza. It's just not worth it and I don't understand how they're rated so high. There are so many better pizza options in Denver (especially in this area... like Walters 303).\n\nThe pros:\nThey're open late.\nYou can order it off uber eats.","resp":{"time":1484553252827,"text":"Hi Ryan. Saw your review from yesterday. Glad you enjoyed using Uber EATS. Sorry your pizza was seemingly (from your photos) underdone. Patrick and I do our best to provide a consistent pizza at a reasonable price @$15-$16 per. I have not yet eaten at Walters 303 but all of the 14\" pizzas on their menu cost more than ours.

We even joked with each other about it as we saw him serving and being diligent with all of the other tables around us but it was as if we were invisible.\nLong after we finished dessert he came and asked us if we wanted to stay around for awhile or if we'd like the check. We asked for the check.. It was close to 30 minutes later when he came in to check on us...we just politely asked for the check again and he brought it quickly. We didn't want to be rude. The restaurant was not that busy or full so it was a little strange to us.  I checked for an e-mail address to contact about our experience as I didn't want to leave a public message like this. But, there are no posted contact e-mails on the website. It just wasn't the setting for a Valentine's Day date.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7ba801f7b1af:0xfddb3bda57442d3e"}

We got street parking and walked through a small park where people were playing a good game of kickball in order to get there.  Jonsey\u2019s had a very good happy hour going on at the time.  We could get much of the good quality craft beers on the menu for half off alongside their selection of fries for $5.  I found this place after a tweet from Alton brown that had a link to the 30 greatest fries in America.  Jonsey\u2019s landed number 28 on that list.  Knowing this I had to try them since I was conveniently in Denver at the time.\n\nWe ended up trying three different types of the fries, which was far more than enough food for two people.  Yes I had dinner that day completely of French fries.  The three varieties we went for where the Truffle, which were my favorite and had a truffle aioli and shaved parmesan.  We also had the Green Chili, which was a requirement, being in Denver you have to get as much as you can with green chili and these fries were an example of how the mild flavor of that chili makes Denver\u2019s love affair with the chili completely justified.  Last up on the list were the Asian version that had a tangy sweet and sour sauce.  Before trying them I wouldn\u2019t think that this would work before I tried it, after the fact though the sweet and salty effect that you get with these fries really works.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7928f1fee80d:0x18120e5d4883f0b1"}

I think you get a bit more food with the bowl, so that is an even better deal\n\nEveryone who worked here was so friendly, and the whole atmosphere is very charming.

{"user_id":1.02070776e+20,"name":"Anthony Alvior","rating":4,"text":"I really enjoyed this hole in the wall Hawaiian restaurant, and it was a great find after just landing in Colorado.  They have two portion sizes for meals, regular and mini, and to be honest, the mini is the perfect size for being satisfied and not overly full.  I ordered the mini sized portion of the Honey Garlic Chicken which had a scoop of rice and the delicious macaroni salad, and I also added an order of the Spam Musubi.  The food was so good and very inexpensive.  The restaurant is small but has plenty of room for seating.  The restaurant is relatively clean, and when we came for an early lunch (around 10:45ish) there was only one person working the restaurant.  She was doing the cooking and taking the orders both from the phone and walk-ins.  I felt bad for her, and didn't complain that our food took a little time to come out.  We weren't in a hurry anyways, and it was well worth the wait.  Fortunately, right around the start of peak lunch time, two other people came to help her out.\n\nI definitely recommend this place if you're passing through the area and want a taste of Hawaiian food.  It seems like the locals come through here quite often.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c770437daa6c5:0x59034fcd5fcf27c2"}

And then sorta liking it but not really?\n\nCame in on a Sunday morning for some sweet sweet brunch action.  Made a reservation but really didn't need to in the end.\n\nWe came in as a double-date 4-top, and were promptly seated.  That was the first and last \"prompt\" aspect of our meal.\n\nWe ordered a round of drinks.  The fresh-squeezed Granny Smith apple juice was pretty nice, with a bit of whiskey in it, and that made it even nicer.  Unique and tasty!\n\nI ordered a greyhound with vodka, and it seemed to cause some confusion.  Waitress eventually made and brought out a damn-good greyhound with fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice.  Hell yeah.\n\nMy Hangover Skiller was tasty, and my girlfriend's hash was solid with big chunks of meat.  All served in piping-hot small cast iron pans, nice.\n\nMy only complaint was the delay in everything.  We arrived at 1115am for brunch: we finally left at nearly 1pm.  There was a single waitress for eventually-5 tables, and 2 other employees that I never saw do anything other than be engrossed in their phones.  The waitress was obviously overwhelmed, as she seemed to be the bartender as well as everything on the front-end, and the resulting delays were noticeable.\n\nAnother front-end staff member would have turned this brunch into a very pleasant affair, but instead, it left us scrambling to rearrange our schedule after a nearly-2 hour brunch.\n\nGood food, good drinks, but not a fan of 2-hour meals, especially when the blatantly-missing staff is the sole cause for this.\n\nWould be 2 stars, but the food was really good.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7eb5165fcf1f:0x1533ea96f56b3d05"}

{"user_id":1.07033106e+20,"name":"Holland McKnight","rating":1,"text":"We decided to have dinner here New Year\u2019s Eve before going to a nearby event. Our visit started with waiting 15min for the valet which never showed so we ended up parking around the corner. Because of our tardiness our party had already been seated, we arrived to a freezing cold room, everyone was huddled up with their winter coats on trying to stay warm. I thought it was odd that they had one of the front doors propped open during a winter storm only adding to the problem. The waiter at this point began to apologize for the poor service stating that they were extremely under staffed which was apparent when he was in such a rush taking out drink order he forgot someone in our party. The restaurant seemed very empty so I was surprised that being \u201cunder staffed\u201d was such a big deal. After a long wait for drinks We were disappointed in the fact that they ran out of martini glasses so the drinks were served in a regular cocktail glass which normally wouldn\u2019t be an issue but when it\u2019s already freezing cold you don\u2019t really want to be holding onto a cold drink. Most of us has decided on a starter of the soup of the day which was potato and leek, this sounded great to warm us up but when we went to order we were told this was now unavailable. After ordering and waiting for a while we noticed that the other tables had bread and since we were starving by this point we asked for some which was brought out with our food. I ordered a well done burger which was delicious but the other two people in our party had ordered their burgers medium which were both very well done. We were definitely disappointed with this experience. I thought the food was decent and good quality but this has to be the worst service I\u2019ve ever experienced in any restaurant.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c792985779de9:0x29ebc6b932470f93"}

{"user_id":1.172090935e+20,"name":"Ashlynn McCarthy","rating":2,"text":"I sat here waiting on a colleague for over 10 minutes without even being offered water. They have an EXTREMELY limited menu. Despite the small, simple menu, the kitchen staff refused to caramelize onions for a customer. This is a simple request when the kitchen already serves onions and uses a cooktop. Given the price of this place, and their utter refusal to accommodate even simple customer requests, I can guarantee I won't be back. Nor will I take business colleagues there for lunch after this. I've had better service at much less expensive eateries. It's an embarrassment to take a business associate to such a nice place only to have approximately 7 menu options, slow service, and completely unaccommodating kitchen staff who already have a ridiculously simple menu to prepare. I have heard nothing good from the guest I took here. I'd have had a better experience for my guest at a Chick-fil-a. Shameful.\n\nThe food I did get was not good. I ordered the grilled cheese, pretty hard to mess that up. But boy did they.... The bread was so dry it literally crumbled to the touch and felt like sand in my mouth. I don't think they even used butter to help retain the softness of the bread. I'm no chef, but who makes a grilled cheese so dry it crumbles before you can eat it? I literally threw the whole thing away. Their menu is also scant on food description or side item listing. My food came with fries. Turns out what that means is it comes with a side of black pepper soaked in fry oil with a hint if potato. Who eats peppered fries?! Why wouldn't they tell you about such an unusual preparation of a ubiquitous item?\n\nAnd before management responds with an invite to email them to discuss it, let me just say don't bother. It'll be a waste of your time. Not even free food would entice me to return to such subpar food and endure such poor service. There are tons of better options in Denver that don't require you to chance a business meeting on bad food, poor service, and unaccommodating kitchen staff who have less to prepare than the average fast food line cook and don't even do as well as a line cook. If you're going to spend $20 per person for lunch, go anywhere else.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c792985779de9:0x29ebc6b932470f93"}

Randolph's is a large, elegant, airy, well-appointed space, with comfortable seating and lovely views of downtown.  There are cloth towels in the men's room.  I always appreciate a hotel that will go to the time, trouble, and expense to provide this simple luxury.\n\nTo start, we were treated to some wonderful ciabatta, hot out of the oven, with a perfect garlic chive butter.  As an appetizer we had the lump crab cake accompanied by a sauce that was a little overbearing for my taste.  My partner, who goes sauce-free, thought the crab was perfect.\n\nWe then enjoyed the escarole Caesar salad.  The dressing was a little too lemony for our taste, and we agreed that we would have preferred the standard romaine.  However, the salad was super fresh and well-presented and especially good with a little more of that ciabatta.\n\nOur main courses were outstanding.  My partner loved his scallops, and my pork loin was over the top.  I asked for a substitution in accompaniments, and they cheerfully obliged.  The result was perfect, with a lovely sage flavor just in time for the holidays.\n\nWe finished with the deconstructed New York cheesecake, a sweet finish to a great meal.  A strange element was a piece of lettuce which might have been meant to be a green presentation aspect.   Maybe they ran out of mint.\n\nOur server was perfect, but other staff could have been more punctual in removing our leftover plates.\n\nAll in all, it was a great meal in a lovely setting.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c792985779de9:0x29ebc6b932470f93"}

Okay good for them. But I doubt they would get new business when it seems like a scam. I know everyone at my office is pretty angry.

They all looked at each other until a half came walking from back with our order and anothers order.  This has set the tone and will definitely not support this place again.

We had no trouble getting a table for 4 on a Friday night and were quickly waited upon. Our food came out 5 minutes after we ordered, which was clutch because all of us were starving.\n\nSpeaking of the food, the sprouts and the fries both missed in terms of how well they were cooked. The sprouts were practically charred with no remaining signs of green and the fries were a bit soggy in places - impressive given they're so thinly sliced. Flavor on both of the dishes was superb, so it was not a complete disappointment.\n\nThe burger that I had - classic double Park Burger - was the star of the show. The meat had a depth of flavor you don't find in your typical chain-restaurants like Five Guys. It was a simple set of toppings on top of some impressive meat and nothing was insanely expensive, even being in RiNo.\n\nFor the price, I would definitely come back to Park Burger.

It was almost as if we sat outside and it started raining we would have to stay out there. I thought maybe she could see the puzzled look on my face but apparently not. As we sat there for less than an hour she sat group after group outside. Id say at least 10 different parties and we were sitting close to the hostess stand and i could hear her offering \"inside or patio?\" Um excuse me what? The waitress was very dull. Didn't really seem to care too much about making us happy. She gave us the bill as i was still eating and said no rush. Right after i put my card down she came right over to swipe it in these machines they walk around with. Then she pointed it to the gentleman I was with. I feel like maybe those machines arent the best idea for this reason. We were both embarrassed and even though she felt bad about it I was very uncomfortable and felt bad for the gentleman I was with. The food was ok. There are no chicken sandwhich options for people who don't eat burgers. They have veggie burgers and Turkey burgers but no chicken?? No option to add chicken to the salad?

Karaoke song selections are very limited compared to other song banks. They don\u2019t take walk ins, you have to make a reservation. There have been More than a few times when they have closed early, so not really midnight at all times. Food options suck and kitchen closes early. And they will not let you order delivery after kitchen has closed.\n\nIf you do actually want to show up to this place after all that, just make sure to make your reservation is way ahead time.\n\nAnd 2, clarify your form of payment at the beginning (before you sing) because it sucks when they charge the whole bill to the one making the reservation or the one that put their card on file. Even if you wanna pay cash they still need a credit card on file, so keep that in mind. The fastest way is to just charge credit on one account because anything outside of that and they will eff it up.\n\nThe one plus to this place is that it has private karaoke rooms. The negative is that they have a monopoly.","resp":{"time":1563818347611,"text":"Thank you Richard for your feedback. We are certainly disappointed to see we missed the mark with your experience.

The salads were delicious and fresh but when the pizza came, we were shocked - it was a 24\" pizza - slices bigger than my hand!  I said I ordered an 18\", and the young lady that brought it said they don't sell 18 inch pizzas in-store!?  The menu has 12\" and 18\" but no 24 inch pizzas.  I wish the counter woman let me know.

Super easy solution: go somewhere else.","resp":{"time":1546888410805,"text":"Hi Steve, we are sorry to hear about your wait time.  While it makes us sad to hear that you probably wont be returning to our restaurant, we hope that you keep in mind why we have a long wait time (during peak business hours) in the first place.\n\nAt Anthony's Pizza & Pasta we make every one of our pizzas by hand, using fresh, simple ingredients and we have done it this way since 1984.  This takes time and we believe that this is what sets us apart from our competitors and creates a demand for our real, thin crust, pizza that we are so passionate about making every day.  During peak business hours, there is sometimes an increased demand for our pizza. Just as it is with any restaurant that makes amazing food, wait times are inevitably going to increase.\n\nSo while we do understand that waiting over an hour for a pizza might not be ideal for you, we would say that you can always plan ahead and order online ahead of time, so you can receive your pizza when you would like it (even during peak business hours).\n\nThanks for taking the time to provide us with the details of your experience and if there is ever anything that we can do to invite you back into our restaurant, please reach out to us directly at info@anthonyspizzaandpasta.com and we will do our best to win you back."},"gmap_id":"0x876c648801c23e2f:0x4c8c354620650fda"}

There was only one time when an older lady (manager maybe?) Was extremely rude. We were dining in once and  my husband asked her for ranch and she gave him ONE... it was four of us eating. Then I got up and asked her for more and she said she had already given some to my husband. How dare she?! So I asked ok? Can I get more??? Then she said she would have to charge me (OK?!) That would have been completely fine, it's only a few cents, but her attitude was uncalled for. I have to admit I always very upset at this point but I said OK charge it so she did, she took my money and pretty much threw the change on the counter (literally, the coins were all over the counter) and just as I was about to say something (again, I was not happy at all) she turned around and left me talking. Believe me I do not like to cause problems but I can't stand people being this rude. I understand people have bad days but if you can't do customer service stay in the back. I wish I could remember her name, if I see her again I will be sure to update my review.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c6386dc00af93:0xacce4ec33c7c147b"}

Their staff works in incredible fashion during games to make everyone's experience the best. It can be hectic but they're all awesome.

I had high hopes for this place but was actually a  complete waste of my money because the food was  undercooked and frankly not edible and I was unable to eat what i ordered and I left the plate mostly uneaten.

Thank You for opening your restaurant in Aurora. You're  a destination in Aurora and East Colfax. An awesome place to come to after church or to celebrate .

A gentleman at the check out counter said...\"next please\" the next in line was talking with a co-worker and didn't hear...honest mistake.  He only had to repeat himself 1 more time and I hear him say not under his breath....\"Jesus Christ pay attention\" which the customer did not hear...but I did.  My friend was paying and another lady at the counter asked do you need anything else?  My friend didn't hear her.....she rudely makes her voice louder and says.....DO YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE?  He said no that is it.  He goes to hand her his card....instead of asking him to use the machine to use the chip...she rudely points to the side as though he should have already known.  The only person to walk by and say hi....the manager or someone in a suit.  I understand....you are a busy coffee shop....but take the time and smile and have fun.

I asked the manager whether they are supposed to grill it before serving it and he said so and explained that maybe the dough just had too much water in it.

{"user_id":1.00819225e+20,"name":"Adam Sattley","rating":5,"text":"Bistro Barbes\n\nSummary: truly a unique, hidden gem! Who would have guessed we have a North African inspired modern French restaurant in Park Hill? And it's been here for four years!\n\nLocation\/Parking: Park Hill, near Elm and 26th Street. Street parking only.\n\nAmbiance: small and narrow; nothing too fancy; elements of North African culture.\n\nService: top notch! A very high-level that you would expect at the most expensive French restaurants.\n\nCocktails: we tried a house drink made from spiced cranberry shrub and ginger beer.\u00a0 It contained the spice called fenugreek. It was very exotic. It set the tone for the evening.\n\nAmuse-bouche: complimentary, ever-changing. Ours was tasty.\n\nAppetizers: we selected the beef cheeks. They were extremely rich, but paired nicely with a more sweet and tangy coleslaw mix.\n\nSalads: we split the shaved pear salad as an appetizer as well. It came over a bed of brie cream and figs, topped with a red wine-cacao gastrique.\n\nEntrees: they were out of duck leg, so they informed us they would be substituting it for duck breast. Toni and I still ordered the duck, and it was cooked to perfection! It was set atop of saffron basmati rice, roasted brussel sprouts, and butternut squash chips. Bob ordered the hanger steak. It looked amazing! It was served with raclette over a bed of kale. I tasted some of the steak and it was really delicious.\n\nDesserts: we had been warned that the desserts are fairly small, but we still decided just to split one dessert among the three of us. It was perfect. We ordered the chocolate hazelnut creme brulee. It was definitely a different take on this traditional dessert, as it did not come in a ramiken, but was served over a pool of rosewater-infused white chocolate with supremed orange segments, and petit meringue cookies.\n\nAll in all, this was a great experience! I highly recommend checking it out. We visited on the Thursday night before Christmas and it was very slow. Hopefully they get much more business soon!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7be5470a6909:0xa90c396ab34d42ff"}

It's about eight total table with one high top closer to the open kitchen.\n\nI had the Pei Mussels for appetizer. The garlic chive sausage, padron Chili's, leeks, Dijon-paprika brodo was a perfect harmony of smell and unforgettable surprise for my palette. The broth. Above average in taste. Served with fresh baked bread. Once you dip that bread you're hooked. I swear I almost didn't go beyond the appetizer. I just wanted more of that mussels. When the waiter came to clear the plate for my next dish I had to restrain myself from stopping him.\n\nThe shaved Bartlett Pears came next. My aversion to sweet entree, salad or anything else that's not desert was totally squashed here. The Marcona Almond vinaigrette, black mission figs, Brie crema , red wine-cacao gastrique all worked in perfect harmony to produce an end result that was perfectly in sync.\n\nI chose the Hanger Steak for my entree since a couple of nights ago I had an amazing fish dinner. I'm mostly a meat eater. I know my meat. I am in awe of this entree. Super tender to start with. Perfectly cooked as requested medium. Pink and so enticing. The streak sat on top of sweet potato raclette aligot, saut\u00e9ed kale, Moroccan roasted carrots, red wine-sage jus. Amen!\n(P.S Aligot is made from mashed potatoes blended with butter, cream, crushed garlic, and melted cheese.)\n\nI had their old fashion to keep me a bit distracted and I went home enchanted.\n\nAnd that creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e....\n\nThis is an off the beaten path location that is perfect for a date night with a special someone.

We did not have any of the vegan options, but intend to try them the next go around. We ordered from UberEats on a Sunday evening, for whatever reason my experience trying new-to-me restaurants at the end of a weekend has not been good via Uber. This was not the case here. When trying a new pizza spot, we tend to order the basics. If they can nail the basics, then it's likely that everything else will be done well too. We ordered the pepperoni and breadsticks with a side of pizza sauce for dipping. Wow. The pizza toppings were perfectly dispersed, a nice amount of slightly spicy red sauce, hand-tossed crust leaning toward the thin crust side (good thing), pepperonis were slightly crispy, the cheese blend and sprinkled seasoning evenly spread, all perfectly cooked, and cut appropriately. The breadsticks were a bit fluffy, flavorful on their own, and paired well with a slightly spicier pizza sauce for dipping. Job well done.

My fiance and I regularly visit T-Mama's for their 10\" vegan cheese pizza and vegan chicken empanadas. Both are incredibly tasty (don't buy the GF crust, it is very hard and not very tasty)! The owners are very kind and courteous, each time we come in we're greeted with a smile and hospitality.\n\nMy only complaint (and not worth demerits) is the pricing. We have not tried any of the specialty vegan pizzas due to the high pricing. If the pizzas were offered at a more competitive rate, we likely would venture out past the cheese pizza. Unfortunately, we have noticed other vegan options here are raising in pricing. I hope this is not a trend as we may have to stop visiting as regularly! Either way, I am grateful to have them as an option. Thank you T-Mama's for offering vegan items!","resp":{"time":1581447979828,"text":"Hi, we appreciate the comments and the feedback. Yes, we are making all efforts to achieve a better cost of the vegan ingredient's supply, curiously most of the vegan ingredients are coming from out of State and the distribution costs are not helping.

An hour later I received my pizza and they gave me half off the order which was great, but I opened the box for the pizza and you could tell it was rushed. It was a pineapple and ham and all of the pineapples were thrown in the middle. Not only did I have to wait for the remainder of my order, but it wasn't great quality at all and it made me even more upset. I was supposed to get a call, but never did after reaching out to customer support.

We must accept the risks we would be taking if we were to dine out of the home, which may be smaller or greater for different individuals. This review is just something fun to read. :)\n\nLast Sunday evening, I met Steve for an early dinner on the patio of Gattara, a relatively new Italian restaurant attached to the Warwick Hotel at the intersection of 17th and Grant.\n\nMasks were worn by all parties until we were completely seated. We sat outside on the patio, where the closest patron was about 20 feet away.\n\nOur waiter was named Sean, and he was great; he was very attentive. We had the choice of dining inside where we would have been extremely social-distanced from the closest neighboring patrons, or similarly spaced out on the patio. It was a beautiful afternoon, and late enough in the day that the sun was hidden by the tall buildings of downtown Denver, so we chose the patio.\n\nAccording to their website, \"Gattara\" is the Italian equivalent of 'cat lady', without some of the negative connotations we have in America. This type of cat lady also feed stray cats in her neighborhoodand, as an endearing quality to the community.\n\nWe both ordered a signature cocktail called the Angora: Hendrick's Gin, St. Germain, white cranberry juice and fresh lemon juice. It was very cool and refreshing.\n\nThe restaurant offers Neapolitan-style pizzas that range between $12 - $18, and upscale entrees $21 - $44. However, we decided to share four appetizers $6-$16. Steve took a margherita pizza \"to-go\" for his other half, and it received rave reviews!\n\nThe French baguette burrata toast was delightful. It contained grana padano, arugula and tomato jam.\n\nSteve especially liked the confit San Marzano tomato! This bruschetta was generously topped with house-made lemon ricotta and basil on a crispy focaccia bread.\n\nThe charred octopus was cooked to perfection and contained fregola, peperonata, garlic chips, radishes, and frisee. The bright red sauce under the octopus was rich and creamy.\n\nThe star of the appetizer show, and most expensive, was the smoked pork cheeks with Yukon gold gnocchi! It was served with mache and giardiniera. The pork cheeks melted right into our mouths!\n\nHotel restaurants can be very hit-or-miss. This one was a hit! Hopefully their business picks up, as it was pretty slow last Sunday evening. Reservations can be made via OpenTable.","resp":{"time":1595541121399,"text":"Good afternoon Adam, Thanks for taking the time to review and share your experience with us at Gattara.

{"user_id":1.015516877e+20,"name":"Mile High Food Fairy","rating":5,"text":"Two paws up for real tasty pizza.\n\nGattara delivers delicious appetizers and pizzas, and breaks down the \"hotel restaurant\" stereotype.\n\nGattara, which means \"cat lady,\" is a cat-themed Italian-American restaurant downtown, located next door to the Warwick Hotel. Yes, I did say \"cat\" themed! You can find adorable cats in artwork along the walls and even hidden elsewhere. The interior is very spacious, with high ceilings, with a calm, warm atmosphere. There's a bar and even a brunch bar with bottomless mimosas available on the weekends.\n\nNow onto the food.... the pizzas are bomb. They offer creative, wood-fired, Neopolitan-style pizzas like the carbonara and prosciutto di parma pizzas. My favorite was definitely the prosciutto di parma, although the carbonara is worth a try as well. The prosciutto di parma comes with mascarpone, pecorino romano, arugula, and cured egg yolk. I'm pretty sure I've never had pizza elsewhere with egg yolk on top, but it was incredibly delicious! They also offer gluten-free pizza crusts, which is what we got. The gluten-free crust has the perfect chewy consistency and is made with gluten-free beer.\n\nBesides the diverse selection of pizzas, they also offer fun seasonal ones. I had the opportunity to try the Thanksgiving pizza, which had cranberry orange puree, shaved acorn squash, brown sugar, mozarella, and turkey meat.\n\nNow on to the appetizers... they have some very pretty (and delicious) shareable appetizers. My favorites would include the san marzano tomato focaccia, charred octopus, and the potato strata.\n\nBesides the delicious pizzas (highly recommend that prosciutto di parma pizza!!), they have a super delectable oatmeal raisin cookie ice cream sandwich. I love ice cream (probably way too much), but this was vanilla ice cream with lavender sprinkled on top, sandwiched between two super chewy, thick cookies. Not only that, but it is served with a rich house-made caramel. Oh man, oh man, I'm craving it just by writing about it!\n\nGattara is a definite winner and worth checking out. It's charming for cat lovers, an excellent ladies' brunch spot, and great for a date night.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c792984efffff:0xceb7fe0344cc38c"}

The server immediately stopped me, and showed me these round things that they also brought out, along with a giant bowl of water. Turns out those are rice noodle wraps, and we're supposed to get them wet, then make rolls out of them. He patiently showed us how to make awesome rice wrap rolls, and told us stories of how this was one of his family's tradition when they got together.

They had a regular come in and knew his order right away and obviously they value their relationships! We were definitely impressed by the service and can't wait to go back. And on to the food, it was AMAZING! The pizza had a great sauce and crispy crust. Very comparable to a pizza we had in NYC.

I was working a 14 hour graveyard shift about a mile away from here and got very hungry around 7PM. I found them online having never ate here before, and noticed they were closing soon. So I called for delivery, hoping they could make change for a $100 bill, which was all the money I had on me. Even though drivers aren't supposed to carry that much, the amazing woman taking my order figured it out for me and got my order to me within an hour, even delivering after they closed and the food was still piping hot. She absolutely saved my night and I'm truly impressed by the effort made to satisfy a first time customer. I ordered a suprimo calzone, a chicken parmesan sandwich, and ravioli, and everything was phenomenal. The portions were huge, especially the calzone, and the size of the ravioli along with the huge amount of sausage in the dish was well worth it. The garlic twist that came with the ravioli was flaky and warm deliciousness. The marinara was amazing. This was honestly the best Italian food I've ever had. Worth every penny and the service is worth a good tip. While the wait can seem long as some others complain about, I'd say it's absolutely worth the wait, and you can always order an hour or two before you plan to eat. Shouts out and thank you to the crew of Primo's for an amazing meal that got me through the long night, I will definitely be a repeat customer.","resp":{"time":1489258642317,"text":"Mason,\n\nThank you for taking the time to write this review.

I ordered the pizza well done; it looked great from the top, however the Ibottom was tough and hard to chew. Calzone was also disappointing. The calzone crust was bland and the texture was all wrong. Im thinking tonight there was a problem with the dough. However, I am not willing to waste another $40 to find out if it was an isolated incident. (Should Primo's know they had an issue, assuming that was not their normal crust, I would be willing to try a pizza on the house. That is assuming, you value your customers. Otherwise, we will go elsewhere.) Also the sides of sauce for the calzone tasted like it contained hot sauce. Odd.... I know garlic can be spicy, and there was garlic in the sauce, however, our sauce had a kick that was beyond garlic!! It was ok, but I love spicy so I didnt mind. My husband, on the other hand, could not eat it. Do want to mention the girl that took the phone order and delivery guy were both very nice. The delivery guy even thanked me for checking them out. Too bad that alone is not enough.","resp":{"time":1515696256816,"text":"I could not wait to finally have time to respond to this review. Let me start out by saying that we are a very small shop that tends to get very busy. We told you up front that your delivery time would exceed 90 minutes and you were quite alright with that on the phone. In addition to that, you requested to have a crispy crust, which I said, would make your pizza very dry. Apparently that was not an issue for you until you received your order (the rest of our conversation, to save you some embarrassment, I will just leave out). In the end, we realized that there are just some people that are not worth wasting time on.\n\nOn a side note, because of you, we no longer do \"CRISPY\" crust.

Got some oysters and was pretty good, service was friendly and efficient.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c791fee162725:0x61ae6901e7165fa8"}

Neat idea having multiple types of dishes under one roof in a Buffet environment.  But.....   After being seated by a polite lady, I proceeded to the buffet where I picked up an egg roll, some fried rice, Beef and Broccoli and a ham cake.   Tasted ok, nothing spectacular but I do have to admit that the food wasn't very warm.  I guess after 2 bites I should have known better but I was hungry and wasn't thinking properly about food safety.   While sitting there eating I also noticed that people were adding new food to old food on the buffet.  I guess I really didnt think anything of that either.  (Little did I know at the time this is a health department violation)  After finishing my first plate I went back to the buffet and picked up a different type of eggroll looking thing, I think it was called a Vietnam roll or something of the sorts, a piece of red colored chicken on a skewer, and a couple pieces of what looked like coconut shrimp.   After biting into the roll thing which was barely warm and mushy inside and had the texture of cat food I immediately put it down and asked the waitress lady if she could take the temperature of the food on the buffet.  I freaked out when she finally found a thermometer and shoved it into a roll and it registered at 104 degrees farenheit... Oh crap...   while she was doing this I noticed that the cold items area was also not very cold.  Glad I didn't get anything from the dessert area....   I asked for a refund based on unsanitary food conditions.  Hot food needs to be kept at or over 140 and cold foods at 40 or under or you can make people VERY SICK.    The waitress kindly notified me that the steam table was malfunctioning.   Shouldn't they have just taken all the food off and not used that buffet line?  Or am I freakin insane ?","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c767ba65d04bf:0x1a72fe82cd732266"}

We dropped $200 for two people and walked away almost hungry. It gets pretty ridiculous with some dishes, like the 4 scallops they served on a giant peace of marble, neatly arranged on one side of the marble block, leaving 3\/4 of the area empty. It was listed as a main course, but did not come with any carbs or salad to complement the scallops. The scallops themselves should have been cooked perfectly for that price, instead they were fried for the same amount of time, the two bigger pieces being very good, but the two smaller ones being overcooked, and who really wants to eat overcooked scallops? We also got some flavorful, but under-cooked, risotto. And when we sent it back, instead of making a new batch, they just reheated what remained on the plate. How much did I pay for this again? The bread served at the beginning of the meal came out of a fridge, it would be nicer if it were warm. On the plus side, the decor is great, but a little crowded. The cheese platter was very unique and totally worth it.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7935705f2627:0x3ca74e35dcfdf6ee"}

There's not a successful system for them to handle their popularity. Clearly understaffed which is 100% a management issue.The door man that did come out was lovely. Very fun and personable.

And I also find it funny that we were told there wasn't any manager on duty when we asked the bartender if we could speak to one. The only thing about horror in this bar is the experience. If your looking for legitimate drinks with class and awesome showcase to them go to adrift or Welton room.","resp":{"time":1619628068667,"text":"Hey there Tanner.

Unfortunately after analysis of our market sales and finances it was determined not to be viable to continue.   The vendor costs to sell at this market are very high...much higher then any other market we have attended in the past.  Yes the prices are higher to help compensate for the high vendor fees but the sales volume are not high enough to make a viable long term business so we went out of business this year.

The one that I've tried most recently was the Arroz con Pollo. The fact that it comes with queso on it is pretty much one of the main reasons I ordered it (I just wanted something comforting) but even queso aside, all the other flavors were there. Additionally, there were NO WEIRD CHICKEN BITS. Seriously, nothing ruins a meal for me faster than biting into some chewy fatty meat.\nFor dessert, I also got some of their chocolate chip cookies which are just perfect.. crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside.\nWhile this stay-at-home order has been a bummer, it's been super comforting to know that I can still get my ClusterTruck fix at a meetup point.

Might as well go back to Smashburger for burgers, Subway for sandwiches, and Mellow Mushroom for pizza.\n\nTotally destroyed the awesome opportunity you guys had to cater to those workers throughout Denver. Now you're just an overpriced ClusterTruck.

The salsa is watery and flavorless, and the chips are of your thick, deep-fried variety; they do not compliment each other at all. Expect to pay $10-$15 for an entree that is probably worth more in the neighborhood of $7-8. Their shredded chicken is 'marinated' or slathered in some type of generic tomato sauce, (some simple seasoning would easily rectify this), and their \"Scorpions\", which are basically miniature shrimp wrapped in a pepper with cheese were deep fried to the point of having the texture of tree bark. Their homemade tamales are completely flavorless and lacking any kind of seasoning what-so-ever.\n\nUnfortunately, I won't be recommending this place and will not be returning.

Wish people talked to me more the staff didn't really make a conversation with me while doing my nails she seemed in her own world or annoyed by me but i really didn't say anything and how i ment from talk like casual conversation about the weather or day not about the cost of nails I got when I paid for i understand that just wanted friendly service.","resp":{"time":1598328298626,"text":"Hi Andrea!\nThank you for sharing your thoughts!

I was able to make my booking online. Although that is common for restaurants and other types of services today, nail salons are archaic when it comes to booking appointments. The fact that I was able to make an account, select the services, see the times available, and make a $1 deposit so my spot was secure, felt like the salon knew what they were doing before we even got there.\n\nOnce we did get there, they were extremely welcoming and hospitable. I booked the appointment to celebrate a new job and graduating school with my mom, however she was running a tad late. They were understanding and did not seem to mind a bit. I also ordered the Jelly service which was out of this world! They took time to explain what the service provides for my feet and gave me 20-30 mins to properly use the service, while ever so often coming back to check to make sure I was doing \"ok?\" and the jelly was warm enough.\n\nI had Ashley as a nail artist and she did my pedicure and my manicure. She was extremely detailed on my toes and never once made me feel ashamed for having small toe nails. She was also really enjoyable to chat with and very easy to ask questions about the services. When she did my manicure she explained all that she was doing and then answered any questions I had about potentially getting GelX or acrylic in the future.\n\nThe prices are certainty competitive. I also love how they insure their stones, so if you get stones on your nails and it falls off, go back and they will replace it. For someone just getting into Nail Art, this was a risk that was mitigated.\n\nThe salon was extremely clean and well organized as well. You could tell, even as a newbie, that they had one staffer that was designated to the front \"check in\", and then one designated to: towel, and dirty laundry (dirty towels), and cleaning. I watched her clean a pedicure chair when I was enjoying the jelly bath and I was awesome how detailed they are. Also, they use all new \"nail care\" tools on every individual and then ask if you would like to keep them. Like the file and the buffer. Otherwise they are thrown away. Everything is dipped in rubbing alcohol or cleaning solution if it is a reusable tool. There was hardly any nail dust and you could tell that the salon was swept and mopped often.\n\nFinally, when we first pulled up I saw that we weren't in the best neighborhood, but do not let that deture you. People are friendly and ALL of the staff at Mainstream makes you feel welcome and safe.\n\nWe cannot wait to go back in 3 weeks, and I am looking forward to lasting reoccurring spot to get a girly fix!\n\nThanks Mainstream!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7c7041918bc5:0xb438b2f48a4c8a7e"}

They need to make the smothered chili much thicker and heartier. Tortillas were hard and not fresh . Very disappointed","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7c96d412a935:0x5c7f48685971c667"}

The place itself is a standard old El Camino motel that has been very creatively updated. While my room was smallish, it was more loaded with amenities than many five star hotels - microwave, Keurig coffeemaker (with Starbucks pods), refrigerator, iron and board, cool d\u00e9cor, great bed (pillowcases designating soft and firm) and even a welcome from management in the form of a paper airplane. Everything including hot water worked like a charm. Nice complimentary lite breakfast in pleasant facility. The staff were all great, genuinely happy to be there, and pleasantly helpful.

Our server was attentive and polite but not friendly. There was no suggestions or pairing options offered.\nFinally the bill came, the waitress offered to split off only one person's tab.

There were other customers there past close (which is totally rude) but I just sorta wish the kitchen staff would have complained quieter haha.\n\nThe restaurant itself is absolutely adorable!

Oh yea, and the pesto chibata sandwich was tasty!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c76cac0efd461:0x17aa7cfa146d9070"}

Matthew was my \"sandwich artist\". Well needless to say, Matthew needs lessons in customer service. We were not greeted as we entered the store. When we approached the counter Matthew seemed upset. He did not ask what we would like. He was not asking what kinds of bread.  Slamming things around while refilling product. I went ahead  and started my order. I asked him if he was okay to which he replied in a very argumentative tone, \"im fine, why?\" I told him he seemed upset and we weren't greeted when we walked in the door. So he decided to argue with me in front of my daughter about not being very friendly. I will not be disrespected by somebody in a service position. We walked out while he was cutting our bread. Bad day or not,  you are not allowed to treat people like that.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c76cac0efd461:0x17aa7cfa146d9070"}

I expected the neighborhood to gain dining concepts offering maybe one or two of these things over the coming years, but then Chow popped up out of nowhere and left nothing to be desired. I've been in twice and it's plainly apparent that their chef takes great pride in his work and their management and servers really care about the service they're providing. After dining at many restaurants during their opening weeks, I have to say the lack of 'hiccups' during my visits really does say a lot about the team that they assembled. Hopefully(for locals) Chow remains a hidden gem where you can just walk in, but I wouldn't be surprised if, once word gets out, it becomes a 'reservations encouraged' kind of place.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7eac73b69bbf:0x3a0578e21c2c9f1c"}

The menu is a bit strange because they do not make it clear what you are ordering or what you will get. When you ask someone what the difference is they think about it too. But that certainly does not warrant one or no stars. What does is the hygiene practices at this establishment. I watched the worker take the pita bread and put it on the working surface with his hand, open the pita holder and put it in. The pita holder is a barrier between the employee who for some reason does not wear gloves or a hat but works with fresh food that will be served uncooked. I was one of three people in line (not a peak time), it seemed like everyone was confused as to what to prepare and who ordered what. The gyro meat is shaved off the stake as normal, but they do this ahead of time and put it in a storage bin and heat it on the grill when you order it. This is definitely not the way this is supposed to be done. Falafel balls were mediocre at best just like the service and attention of the staff.\n\nSave your time, choose another spot. When I brought these issues to light, again, they just looked confused and sought no immediate fix or offer to remake the food. I'd rather give my 22.00 to someone outside and skip dinner.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7ea730b58fab:0x97d136e340d36454"}

I decided to give Falafel King a try as I've never been to one before. I was looking forward to getting a dank pita falafel loaded with the usual stuff I get from Garbanzo. Well, I was sordidly disappointed simply over the fact that they charge extra for tabbouleh and baba ganoush which Garbanzo doesn't do. Sure, the green chili hummus was intersting. However, it doesn't redeem the over-priced pita I got. Garbanzo is cheaper and has better options that don't cost \"extra.\" Not to mention, the staff was not wearing gloves when they were stocking the food counter which almost prompted me to ditch the place, but I was kind enough to over-look that part for the time  being. Also, the falafel doesn't taste as good as Garbanzo's falafels. And then the pita wasn't an actual \"pocket\" as the menu suggested it would be. Instead, they just slopped all the toppings on top of the pita like a taco so guess what? The toppings fell out. Yeah, I should've saw that one coming, huh? Garbanzo actually puts everything INSIDE the pita like an actual pocket. Again, I am not mildly disappointed. I am sordidly disappointed. Never again, Falafel King.

I actually had to drive around in my convertible with the top down for an hour after just to de-stress and feel back to normal.  My fiance took hours after to feel calm again.\n\nOkay, so where to begin?  Perhaps the best place to start is I showed up around 1pm, 2 hours after they opened at 11am.  I saw the person who showed up right before me (perhaps the owner?) unlocking the front entrance, so my fiance and I were the first to get in (I'm guessing they opened 2 hours late?).\n\nSo now, we go to sit down.  The table is wobbly, as well as my chair.  Not a big deal, right?  Well, right after that, we notice a child of one of the employees at the other end of the restaurant.  He's watching a kid's video on something with the volume turned up to the max.  You could hear it louder than the music everywhere in the restaurant.  It had a volume that just pierced any conversation and even your inner thoughts.\n\nOh, and wait, there's more!  While waiting for our food, the waitress was sitting on the floor working on some type of project, then took the mop, moved it around, and never washed her hands between that and serving us food.  My fiance noticed that one and didn't let me know until after, so I hope we don't get sick from food poisoning...\n\nThe food actually tasted good (not great, but good).

Jack the bartender also apologized that they were getting slammed with room orders, but we must have hit just the right time, because our order did not take long at all.\nThe wine he picked for my wife's dinner was extremely tasty and went very well with her fillet which was fantastic. You could tell it was aged extremely well and the demi-glaze was so good, she asked for a little more and the waiter\/kitchen was kind enough to bring her extra, extra. Super yummy.\nI am extremely picky about my ricotta, and the fried ravioli did not disappoint. As far as I'm concerned a good ricotta can make or break a resteruant, I was very pleased to see it was very good quality and fresh.\nJack went out of his way to brew me some great iced earl grey tea \u2615, and even sent me out the door with a to go cup.\nMy shrimp linguini hit the spot. The shrimp was fresh, cooked well, Not overdone, and the sauce tasted heavenly.\nWe will be back hopefully to try the Colorado lamb in the future","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c78d3fc0fa943:0xeb7ba64dfdb07d5b"}

The staff is usually attentive the food hot and delicious. Last night we experienced a much different restaurant. They were rolling out a new menu and decided to do it on one of their busiest weeks of the year. Between the first person on our table and the last person on our table being served there was a half an hour wait time. Drinks were overcharged allegedly because of a slipped finger from our server however it was not corrected until we brought it to her attention. I like spicy food and this was at my higher limit. The vegetarian bowl was 90% rice with a few pieces of broccoli and tofu thrown in for good luck. The falafel is mediocre at best. The brie however was delicious but served with too few pieces of bread. Service was slow, our water bottle consistently empty, and I was never asked if I would like an adult beverage. I understand that it's a new menu and a new chef. This makes me sad as it used to be a five-star establishment. Although the staff was apologetic. We did not learn that one of our dishes did not get sent to the kitchen because of a computer snafu until the end of the meal- thus the long spread between dishes being served. Compensation of that last meal was given however a new menu should not be rolled out  on paying customers. Apologies were not made until the end of the meal when the manager saw that we were not happy and brought the drink error to his attention.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c78d3fc0fa943:0xeb7ba64dfdb07d5b"}

We take pride that we provide an environment where people can grow and eventually feel confident to open their own businesses. The part we don\u2019t love is we lose great people and our guests are then asked to see another esthetician.\n\nSome guests prefer to see solo providers and we encourage them to find a private studio so they don\u2019t experience the staff changes.

I\u2019ve been coming here for three years and this last trip was beyond disappointing. I went in for a brow wax and tint, lash tint and facial. When the esthetician was tinting my lashes she dropped quite a bit of the tint into my eye. I really didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time. However, almost immediately after walking out of their store my eyes started to itch. I thought it was just allergies. The next day I woke up and my eyes were crusted shut, I had to leave town so I couldn\u2019t do anything. Saturday and Sunday became almost impossible to open my eyes without a searing burn. I was able to get into the doctor on Monday and she had suggested it was an eye infection. The next two days I went to eye doctors and they concluded my cornea was burnt from some chemical that fell into..... hmmm maybe the eye lash tint that was basically dumped into my eye. I\u2019ve been talking to the owner and she has no empathy and no customer service skills. Had I not gone to the eye doctor my cornea would have kept being chemically burned. I spent close to $300 at her salon and close to $700 trying to fix my eye. I\u2019m very upset this visit turned into a nightmare. I\u2019ll be going elsewhere from here on out. Currently my eyelashes are falling out and I\u2019m taking steroid eye drops and eye creams. She is willing to give me $25 back as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d....... more like joke. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they get their supplies from Amazon and have no quality control of what is in them or where they come from. I asked for a list of ingredients and she sent me a product list. Basic message: go somewhere else.

They are theives! After inadvertently over paying for my order on a carryout I tried to resolve the issue w\/ the register attendant (Devin) serving me. When that didnt work and i asked to speak to a manager(Brandon). The manager advised me ther was no way to check the drawer amounts for appropriate tallies at that time. With my kids' pizza getting cold and still need ing to be transported, i resolved to allow Brandon to contact me at the number provided after shift hours, once the drawers could be tallied and cashed out. While enroute home i realized there are cameras facing the register drawers and called back the store. I asked to speak to Brandon and formally requested that the surveillance be stopped from cycling over until i have the opportunity to view said surveillance with the franchises' owner. He assured me he would make note of my request. I received no communication after shift, which i diligently stayed up for (the store\/shift closes at 2 so i waited until 4am). I then called the storw back this morning at 10:30 and again asked to speak to a manager. The female (Mary or Marie) stated she was one of the managers. I then reiterated the details of the incident along with the names of the individuals involved and their lack of following thru with their assurance. She asked for additional info such as order number, my name and number, and approximate time of the said occurance. All of which i complied. I again requested i be given the opportunity to view the surveillance of the register afer she confirmed their surveillance cycles over ever 24 hours. I requested also  that i might be put in contact with the franchise owner to resolve the issue. She informed me she would get back to me after ther viewed their records and the video footage but it might be a while as they were \"very busy\" (really? At 10:30 in the morning?!) Despite my suspicion i gave her the benefit of the doubt and waited patiently to be contacted. At 5pm i had yet to hear back so again called the store and asked to speak to a manager when Devin answered my call. This time i spoke to Dillion whom had now knowledge of the incident. He advise me the only way to speak to the owner was to call 1800dominos.. I did this and only got an automated recording advising me to contact the store directly with any discrepancies. To avoid physical conflict that would most likely result in an assult charge, ive brought my discrepancy here. This location has turnd me off to Dominos completely. I hope they know Karma is a b!%@#.

I am writing now to express how pleased I have been with Lucky Noodles!  I have visited it twice in the last two weeks and cannot say enough good things about this quaint, cute, relaxing spot.  The dining area is immaculate, parking out front is easy, and and the food superb.   It is the epitome of a neighborhood gem of a restaurant.\n\nWhen I walked in I was immediately greeted by Ploy, one of the owners.  Ploy was so friendly, caring, and clearly focused on my satisfaction.  I had a few questions about several dishes which she patiently addressed.   I cannot say I routinely have experienced that kind of greeting.\n\nMy first visit I ordered the Mango Sticky rice and Spicy Chicken Pad Thai.  Just perfect!  So flavorful, fresh, and perfectly prepared.   I cannot say enough good about the food.\n\nMy second trip I tried the Tom Yum Soup and Red Curry.  Both were awesome!

The owner or woman i spoke with over the phone while ordering was a delight to speak with and very helpful in choosing things both on and off menu..  There-in-lies the extent of my interest. I am no food critic but found the food to be ridiculously overpriced and portions very small.  G-mas soup,  which I'm sure is great as morning starter has the flavor of cinnamon toast being sweet and filled with cinnamon... with the price being about $13.00 for a small cup with my palette a bit perplexed. My main entre was again $13.00 and a miniscule amount that was a small lunch portion.  I counted 9 pieces of thinly sliced chicken, some green beans and a ton of rice... The soup was Made with chicken wings, which I have no issue but the meat closer to the bone was bloody and I could not get past the flavor and will more than likely dispose of it.  Not sure i buy the excuse given that she charges by the once,  everything being fresh which adds to the cost (but shouldn't food you cook be fresh anyway) and the imported items from ocean pacific on Alameda Street.

So when I saw they finally opened a can taproom I was excited to get down there and see it and try more of their beers.\nI ordered a flight and sadly, I didn't care for anything I had. The beers I ordered were milkshake IPA's and a regular IPA. The flavours were weird or off. I don't think they added enough lactose in some instances and one beer, a strawberry spice rhubarb had so many things going on, it was confusing. Flavours weren't pronounced and seemed...weak.\n\nThe place itself felt empty. And by that, I mean the taproom wasn't inviting or \"warm.\" There were almost zero pictures of mountains on the brick walls let alone any actual 14er pictures. With a name such as they have in a state known for its high peaks, you'd think they would have this aspect dialed in.\nAnd lastly, that music....Jesus. Please lose that stuff. Dance\/techno (Die Antwoord) isn't for everyone. That's actually the main reason why I left after four tasters.\n\nYou guys have some work to do.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c791c05131c91:0x996562bc24ccbd77"}

Their sitting area is just 3 park benches pushed together. If you dont get to find a seat there, you are left standing in the main tap room. The main tap room consist of two barrels and the main bar so plan to bring a fodable chair just in case. The beer selection is ok but for a place that is this bare on the inside you would expect the beer selection to be above average to keep people coming. Did I mention that I witness a art piece randomely falling of a wall and almost hitting another patron? Now. I know some of y'all might think I'm being harsh since they are starting up but for a city like Denver that has plenty of breweries, you would think that a new establishment would try to make sure they are 100% settled before opening their doors to the public.

For proper afternoon tea you need loose leaf with the strainer places over the cup.\n\nThe scones are definitely American\u2014too crumbly to cut in half to properly spread with clotted cream and jam and are also not round so therefore not authentic.

I was also disappointed that the clotted cream did not come with its own spoon so you had to use your own.

I know the magic of it all is creating treasured memories.  What was really touching this year was how attentively the servers and chef cared for my allergies. Over the past year, I have discovered extensive allergies that usually make it very difficult to dine in restaurants. I expected I would only be able to enjoy the tea itself while my children enjoyed the traditional tea sandwiches, scones, and sweets.  Instead, the servers insisted on taking my allergy list to the executive chef, who prepared a beautiful plate of tea treats that were free of wheat, sugar, dairy, and all of my other allergens.  He even managed to make me a sugar free desert!  The food was well seasoned with complex flavors and beautiful presentation.

We have called the restaurant twice about what's going on but we've just been told the driver is lost. It's one thing if we are living off some county road that doesn't register on a map but we live right up Chambers from the restaurant.\n\nWe have really enjoyed the food but it's hard not to be put off a little bit when it takes well over an hour-and-a-half for delivery from a restaurant that is less than 2.5 miles away.\n\nUPDATE: It was finally delivered at 7:59 pm. Food was good but unsurprisingly cold. The driver kind of apologized, if you want to call it that, just saying he couldn't find the home numbers on the house...\n\nWe were offered nothing to make up for the 1 hour and 47 minutes it took to get our food. The Jimmy John's in Commerce City once forgot a bag of chips with our delivery order and within 5 minutes, they sent a credit for a free sandwich on our next order. This was done without us even asking for anything as it was just a bag of chips; hardly something to really even care about.\n\nLong story short, that will be the last delivery order we place with Royal Nepal II.\n\nUPDATE: The restaurant\/Yelp reached out to us in regards to our issue. They have definitely worked to make things right and thus the change from 3 to 5 stars. Like I said, the food is always very good but the issue was the lack of customer service previously.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c6e5315e2865d:0x1272e5e24b271236"}

She requested I send her dates and times of a good time for her to reach out to me for a brief phone screen. I provided her dates and times that same day and the entire week went past without as much as a follow-up email. I sent her a 2nd email asking if she had received my email and if she would be reaching out to me. Most people are excited to get a phone call or email regarding a possible job. Jessi never responded to that email as well. My image, impression and thoughts about the company are now less than stellar. What employees like Jessi do not grasp is the reflection their actions have on the company from an outsider  point of view who are treated as such. Maybe it's a good thing I saw the inner workings. It is certainly not a place I would recommend and I hope the CEO and executive chairman see this review. I am shocked these days at how some people do their jobs or better said don't do their jobs.","resp":{"time":1614624631084,"text":"Hi Mary,\n\nI apologize for your experience with us as a candidate for our HR Assistant position.

The hiring process is a reflection of who we are, and in this case, we fell short of showcasing our company, our brand, and representing our Seattle Fish Co. family.\n\nYour experience with us is unfortunate, and it\u2019s one we plan to learn from moving forward.\n\nSincerely,\nDerek Figueroa\nPresident & CEO"},"gmap_id":"0x876c7bc77c4910bd:0x4de5b386c42c7a89"}

We decided to  go to The Triangle after one of my friends saw their add on Facebook. It was easy to make reservations and they have amazing tables, that maintain social distancing, with little fire pits in the middle for heat. This is real nice to have in Denver during the month of December. The attraction was bingo hosted with a drag show. The two girls in drag were super funny and I really enjoyed the show. It was super fun. Someone that stuck out to me was the hostess Jordan. She is the worker bee of the triangle and dies an absolutely amazing job hosting the tables. I will most definitely be going back in the near future. I was treated with the upmost respect as was everyone else. Just a wonderful LGBTQ friendly establishment. I would recommend this place for anyone that is looking for a judgement free establishment to have a good time.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c78d84200a32d:0xf9313ac2f71067dc"}

They told me no wait and yes to the theft. We were there at 740pm. Apparently a party of 2 adults and 3 kids had just walked in and prior to them a couple.\nWe waited a few minutes as another table was just leaving which left the space for us.\nThe waitress told us to sit with the table all dirty. I told my party to wait until the table was cleaned. When she came back again and told us to sit I ask for the table to be cleaned before we were seated, she grab couple of napkins and proceeded to wipe the table, no sanitizer was used to clean the table.\nWe sat as she had no intention to sanitize the tabl\nShe took a while to get to as and when we order I almost didn't order appetizers but she insisted. I asked how many pieces came in the app plate she said 5. So I said yes, bring that.\nSomeone in my party pointed out later on that it had been 40min so I called on her and ask about the appetizer. Then she brought One piece just apparently deep fried. Super hot, very spicy but only one.\nMy party ate it because they were starving. When I asked about the other 4 pieces she said it was only one and she could order for more I asked just to bring the regular food.\nWhile they ate I approached the server and asked if it was take longer because my party was starving,she said it would be ready soon, they had another big party (the other 5) which made them busy.\nThis was not communicated at any moment when we got there that because of one table of 5 we would be delayed one hour.\nAnother 10min went by and some in my party where literally about to faint. So we decided to leave 1hr and 10min after we arrived with pretty much our bellies empty.\nI was pretty upset as we chose to go there as opposed to go to The Post where the wait was 45min but I knew at least we had to wait.\nHere we waited without knowing we would be waiting for soooo long and still left without food.\nWe went to the other restaurant and it had been free for a while. We could have eaten way earlier if it weren't because we pretty much got held up waiting forever in this cafe.\nSo, no. I would not recommend this place to anyone.\nI never wait more tha  35min for food unless I am inform and I choose to wait for the food.\nI don't know what would take them so long, maybe they make it everything from scratch, which would make sense for the delay but not for a restaurant as you expect no more than 20min wait.\nWhatever their reason was I would not know cuz nobody ever came to talk to us even though the owner was sitting at the back.\nI was hosting for people out of the country and this was a very embarrassing experience.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c7c05dc49be4d:0xe5c72d80c924f6e4"}

Honestly when I see a limited menu I expect them to excel at whatever the items are. I bought the flautas and the smothered burrito. The burrito is not advertised as spicy, but it packs a punch. So much so that for most people it would probably be inedible. Got through half before I have up, leaves a lot to be desired. The flautas: texturally, they're amazing! Nice crunch to them. Unfortunately they chicken was not well seasoned, requiring you to use the salsa they include. Not terrible but still I'd like a little salt. I ordered the extra side of rice and beans with the flautas. Again, lackluster in seasoning, good value as far as price goes. Overall, too many small issues for this to be a go-to spot of mine.

Me puse en frente del mostrador para preguntarle por que no contestaban el tel\u00e9fono para yo poder hacer una orden por tel\u00e9fono y me contesto que llamaban demaciado y que el tel\u00e9fono estava descargado. Cuando que el tel\u00e9fono estava levantado, y por lo consecuente sonaba la linea ocupada.... la verdad muy mal servicio","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c76f5b6148057:0x8c9a01602b2c5a00"}

Second I felt like Norm from Cheers was welcomed like I've been a old friend  of the family. Then I tasted some of the best beer I have had in years. Great selection to choose from, if you enjoy tasting diffrent types of great made beer this is the place . Also they offer a  great menu selection too choose from  Outdoor seating if you choose,  parking no issues, Handicapped accessible.

{"user_id":1.096427982e+20,"name":"kennethconnection","rating":2,"text":"This rating is based on the beer only. The staff was super friendly and certainly aimed to please. I was not a fan of the beer however. The 8in double IPA was the only beer that was serviceable. A citrus hop profile with lemon and orange but lacking in body. This beer would be much better with a lower ABV and sold as a session IPA. The pumpkin ESB and Golden ale were way, way to sweet with excess sugars, these beers both tasted incredibly green, like they didn't have enough time fermenting. The Amber Ale was the worst of all, tasting like someone's first attempt at home brewing from a generic beginners kit. It had no body, no malt flavors, water down, with a seperated taste of alcohol and water, with no hop profile to speak of. I'm sorry for the harsh criticism but There are just too many breweries in Denver to spend the time and money on something sub par. Please improve your beers.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x876c777a6e7651cd:0x2d940fcd9cc686fd"}
