As we were getting settled in, our waiter stopped by to ask what we'd like to drink. He was nice but obviously high or very close to it. He brought us our drinks a few minutes later and took our food order.\n\nWe ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer, 4 of the same meal for our kids, and 2 seemingly simple entrees. When the chips and salsa arrived, it was on a tiny pan with two small salsa cups. We expected much more based on what you get from similar restaurants in the area when you order chips and salsa. All of the chips were gone within a couple minutes of casual snacking.\n\nA bit later, a large group of loud adults were seated right next to us, making it difficult to converse amongst ourselves and making it difficult for others to pass between our tables (which was necessary to access the restrooms, for example). Most of the restaurant was still empty, and yet this large group just had to be seated next to us.\n\nSome 25 minutes after ordering our meals, three of the four kids meals showed up. The waiter didn't hear my wife say \"four\" meals (when she originally told the waiter \"four of XYZ kids meal\" three times). He was very apologetic and immediately got the fourth meal going. About 20 minutes later, we got the fourth meal. My wife and I got out entrees a few minutes later. After nearly an hour of waiting. In a mostly empty restaurant.\n\nMy food was ok. The chicken was juicy and cooked well enough. There was barely any sauce though. My wife's meal was \"meh\" according to her. Each of my kids enjoyed everything except the main part of their meal, which tasted burned because the sauce was old or overcooked or something. My wife said several times that she regretted selecting Applebee's over some of the other restaurants we considered.\n\nThis location is pretty hit or miss. Sometimes things are much faster and tastier, even on busier days.

{"user_id":1.151506914e+20,"name":"Bryce Daugherty","rating":4,"text":"Dickey's is pretty good. This was my first time here so I'm not experienced with this place. I'll say I love the Mac and cheese but that's because I'm weird. To be honest it's exactly the same as cheap buffet Mac and cheese which 90%+ people hate or at least don't enjoy. The beans and chicken were also fairly good. I love the souvenir cup that came with the meal. The problem I had was my brisket. It was dry and pretty tasteless. I barely had a nibble of it before disliking it entirely. I took my problem to the guys at the counter and they exchanged it for turkey - which was amazingly tender and pretty delicious. It needed a little BBQ sauce because it was dry but overall I got my way and am a happy camper. The guy seemed reluctant to trade out the brisket and lacked the friendly customer service I desired. If it was me on the other side of the counter I would've put on a smile, promptly apologized for the lack of quality in the meat, and eagerly replaced it for something else. But maybe I'm too demanding on that subject since I did get my way.  Overall a four star experience.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87528eef34feff41:0xb2913e3706e22839"}

{"user_id":1.003282232e+20,"name":"ian michelsen","rating":1,"text":"Tonight my wife and I chose to eat at the Dickey's in West Jordan. Just as my wife was taking the last couple bites of her brisket sandwich she felt something in her mouth. After taking a closer look I found there was plastic in the meat of her sandwich.  Similar to the plastic you'd find deli meat sealed in at the grocery store. I asked for a manager and was told there was no manager on duty. When I pointed out the plastic in the sandwich, the employee rather casually said \"oh, that's just the plastic we wrap the meat in. It happens sometimes. Do you want another sandwich?\" Now, I wasn't out to get something for free, nor did a want my money back. What I wanted was someone who worked there to acknowledge that it was unacceptable to serve people plastic in their food. Maybe even an apology. Instead it seemed as though the employee thought it was no big deal and I was the jerk for complaining. The plastic in our food is not why I'm giving one star. It's their lousy response to the plastic in our food is why I'm giving one star. Good customer service isn't about making the experience perfect and flawless for the customer. I understand things go wrong. Good customer service is about how they deal with the things that go wrong and this employee failed. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone who wants to feel like a valued customer. Unless you like plastic in your food.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87528eef34feff41:0xb2913e3706e22839"}

So when Alpha Coffee opened near us in late February only to be shut down by the Covid-19 pandemic, my wife and I were waiting anxiously for things to calm down before checking this place out.\n\nWe were not disappointed! The coffee choices are excellent with a heavy lean towards coffee flavor, and away from the saturated sweet-coffee market. The breakfast options range from savory to sweet, and are perfect for on-the-go, or relaxed mornings. And they are delicious! A welcome departure from more well-known coffee chains that don't offer great quality in their food items.\n\nThe staff are bright, friendly and helpful. One of the owners was there while I was ordering and took time to chat and answer questions about the origins and future plans for Alpha Coffee.\n\nWhile seating space is limited, there are a few small tables that I'm sure will be full when the pandemic is over.\n\nI believe my wife and I may have found our new favorite spot, close to home and homegrown in Utah.","resp":{"time":1605585053716,"text":"Thank you for supporting us and other small local businesses throughout this pandemic.

Hopefully that doesn't happen often.\nI went through the door on the left as requested. No windows to look inside. Bell rings when you enter so they can come through the back to help you. Small setup but they certainly have a ton of options.\nAccepted my free bath bomb and decided to buy another. 100mg of CBD in them. One is specific to helping with pain which the guy said is popular. Then I purchased the coconut mango for $14. I thought that was pricey since I have never paid over $5 for a bath bomb. But it seems promising. The man running it was polite and friendly. Seamless experience from beginning to close. If the bathbombs are better than those I have tried before, then I will come back.

By far my favorite real (as apposed to stove top) ramen to get when I need a quick bite to eat. It was fast, fresh, and amazing!

You don't go to McDonald's and expect Gordon Ramsay to be cooking your meal with wagu beef. This is the same idea, they're a small fast food buisness that's going to give you what you payed for and that is fine. In other words, don't expect to get $50 ramen for $10.

I asked if I could order the six inch steak and cheese and get it cutt in half and get a discount (to make it as though I was paying for a slider still). She said no. I asked if I could get any discount under these circumstances. She said no. I asked if there were any other sliders available. He said pork. I shared that I'm allergic to pork. She said that I could order a kids meal which was still double the price of a slider. I went with that and ordered a tuna sandwich kids meal and soup. I wasn't impressed with how they talked with me at all. They were in total shut down attitude towards me. Instead of trying to actively find solutions I had to be the one instigating things this way.

I love all kinds of sushi, but I think it takes a special restaurant for me to really love their sushi.\n\nTaste & Presentation\nWe started the night with 3 appetizers: the Jelly fish, the Salmon tataki, and the Jalapeno Hamachi. When we saw jelly fish on the menu we couldn't resist ordering it and seeing how it would taste. IT WAS AMAZING. I can see why some people may not like it, but I thought it was fantastic and had a similar flavor to that of orange chicken. It wasn't chewy like octopus or squid, but also wasn't slimy. It was a new texture that I had never tried before. If you are a texture person, you definingly should try this dish out. The salmon tataki was an amazing burst of flavors that all complimented each other so well I did not want to stop eating it. Sweet, sour, it had it all. The Jalapeno Hamachi was fantastic and I love how it was presented in the form of a rose. The yellowtail was incredibly tender and just melted in my mouth. As for rolls we ordered the Vulcan, the stargazer and the moonlight. All of them were very well balanced and delicious. The Vulcan without a doubt stole the show though. It tasted fantastic. Imagine a typical Vegas roll, but better. Don't think its possible? It is and its this role. The presentation of all the appetizers and rolls also were beautiful and the unique flavors of everything we ordered was a foodies dream.\n\nVibe & Service\nThe vibe in the restaurant screams San Francisco sushi restaurant. It feels as though you are transported to the bay area and are enjoying a great night with some friends. The service was also phenomenal. I believe the lady who served us was named Inor. She was not only incredibly nice, but seemed to know exactly what we would like off the menu.

All of the food was great, though my favorite aspect was that they brought the food out plate by plate and not all at once which made it great for everyone to try and taste everything. Service was beyond amazing and quick to remove empty plates.\nThey do a lot of their cooking sous vide style so it's extremely tender and buttery. The lamb and wagyu melt in your mouth. My favorite was the sable fish and jalapeno hamachi and you can't go wrong with any of the sushi. Try something you normally wouldn't get and I promise you will be pleasantly surprised. If you're into sweet but not too sweet wine, go with their plum sake. Great place to go for a fun experience and special occasions. Awesome for a double date and anyone wanting try several items throughout a meal. Great Job Mint!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8752631dbd2663a9:0x4dd6d2f106a28c11"}

One of the women told me to personally ask her if we needed anything else (this location is not a sit-down restaurant like the midvale location, but in the style of other \"line order\" places). The baked beans here are the best anywhere. The brisket is also the best - SOOO tender and juicy. You also gotta try the onion chips - a personal fave.

{"user_id":1.058779391e+20,"name":"Lars Barlow","rating":2,"text":"This is really not worth your time. But, I'll try to explain why so this isn't just a negative review.\n\nLet's start with the sides. I got fries and carrots. The fries were actually pretty good. I mean, they are pretty traditional Idaho\/Utah fries. Nice and crispy. Just the way I like them actually. The carrots, on the other hand, were just laughable. They were just steamed baby carrots with kosher salt sprinkled on the top. If you are okay with being charged money for that then ignore the rest of this paragraph. Personally, I think baby carrots are flavorless garbage. Let the carrot grow in the ground properly. But, more important to me, if you can't be bothered to peel and cut the carrots then don't charge money for them. These things were just stupid. I can't think of another word for that. In a modern eatery that charges the kind of prices that Morley's does you should be able to expect some actual time put into the sides.\n\nThe brisket. The texture was nice. The moisture level was fine as well. However, it had absolutely no smoke flavor to it. For the most part the smoke ring was non-existent. Some of the fat collected a little smoke flavor. But, really, there wasn't enough fat to matter. There was also no seasoning on the cut anywhere. Really. No seasoning at all. No nothing. Basically you get a low quality brisket, no seasoning or rub, and next to no smoke. It was clearly cooked too fast and too far. It was not worth the price they charge in any way. It was, in my opinion, not even worth $5. The poor cut of meat was just disrespected in every way.\n\nMy wife ordered the turkey. It was prepared exactly the same as the brisket. It was moist and flavorless. Zero seasoning.\n\nThe sauces, which I think all sauces are just apologies for a failure to prepare the meat correctly, were pretty boring. The two sauces have the exact same flavor. One is slightly tangy and the other is not. Otherwise they are the same sauce. Also, they mostly just taste like Bull's Eye or any other off-the-shelf sauce heavy on the ketchup.\n\nThe ONLY reason this isn't a 1 star review is the mud pie. It was pretty good. I mean, I could see myself going to get a mud pie. I won't ever bother eating here again.\n\nLast thing, I didn't take photos. Not really worth my time to when the food isn't any good.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875286342daf091b:0x25b9b88c4123a637"}

I have two small toddlers and arrived at 12:00 knowing that they weren't going to be very patient. When we showed up the location was dark and the person behind the counter said they weren't going to be opening until 12:30. We killed half an hour walking around and when we came back at 12:30 we were told that they were temporarily out of the only item that we were actually there to get. After inquiring how long they were out of the item for, I was told 10 minutes while they prepared it. Rather than taking our order and preparing the four items that we were there to order, they proceeded to prepare enough for the entire day while we just sat and waited. What should have been a 5 minute trip into the mall with my kids turned into 50 minutes of trying to entertain hungry toddlers and dealing with inefficient employees.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875287c67394d3cd:0x7332a83eecd9bdce"}

One time, water was served and there was lipstick in my drinking glass. Clearly it was used already. Also, it takes them foreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeever to take your order and give you your order and sometimes they don't even ask you what you want to drink. The servers need training. One waitress was just on her phone while we were in need of drink refill and to-go boxes. It was just awful. I hope they will get better but we are never ever ever going back again.

{"user_id":1.004394656e+20,"name":"Kasu Vandi","rating":4,"text":"This is the fanciest fish store I've ever been too!  It was obviously master-planned from the beginning with how the fish tanks are built into the walls which are curved and scalloped into little enclaves.  What impressed me most was the condition of the tanks- ALL crystal clear water with fish swimming around and looking happy overall.  They have a saltwater only enclave section that was mighty impressive- section and sections of corals and similar saltwater plants nicely organized for display and sale, and they had some very interesting invertebrates and creatures (nice marine shrimp selection).  I don't have a saltwater tank but just going through this section made me want one!  Other than the beautifully-presented fish, they have quite a lot of supplies.  What most impressed me was the depth of items they had- such as the hard to find substrates that are packed in water with bacteria (they even had mini versions of these to help your betta tank get cycled and ready to go!), marine substrates, some unusual (but very small selection) tank decor, etc.  They had some nice decorative open tanks with apple snails and live plants, well-displayed empty tank setups for purchase... overall impressive!  They have things that you won't find at the chain stores which was fun to find.  Other than fish, they had an entire reptile section with some geckos, tarantulas, turtles, and some harder-to-find reptiles I forgot the name of, along with all the supplies you would need.\n\nOverall, not only did the fish\/animals look well taken care of but you have an enjoyable time actually walking through and browsing this place unlike some other fish stores I've been to.  This is a great place to bring kids, just a great place overall!  I did find it humorous that two people wondered into here looking for the \"Living Planet Aquarium\" just down the road.  Must bring in some great business for this place. ;)\n\nOnly downsides I found were the prices and the customer service.  A few inexpensive fish I noticed the price of were priced $1-3 dollars higher than some other local fish stores.  But this can be expected due to the look of this place and the great condition of the fish- and I don't mind paying a bit more if I feel my fish are well taken care of and won't have diseases.  I also found the one worker who helped me only moderately knowledgeable, but I never trust fish store workers anyway- at least there were lots of workers around to ask for help if needed.\nOverall, impressed!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875288090df328ed:0x1a4944d78ad99b7d"}

McGrath's, Red Lobster and Joe's were our options. We ventured over to McGrath's because it's \"nicer.\" Who knows. The restaurant is fine. It has your typical chain seafood restaurant decorations, fishing nets hanging from the ceiling, old small fishing boats nailed to the wall, prostitutes looking for sailors...you get the idea. We got the crab stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. I enjoyed these. However, my entre of the pan fried oysters were not as good. My fault, I ordered the wrong thing I guess. It was like a plate of bread crumb pretty much. Everyone else seemed content with their entrees. Service was fine. I'm sure the waitress didn't enjoy working new years day, but she put the best face on that she could. One complaint is that they have signage on their tables that say add a shot of whiskey for one dollar to any cocktail. The waitress said that signage comes from corporate, but they can't honor that deal in Utah because cocktails can only have one shot. So we asked if someone else at the table could have the dollar shot instead and she laughed uncomfortably and walked away. I understand laws in Utah differ from other states, but in that case corporate should provide different table signage, or the local managers shouldn't put them on the tables. That's false advertising and I'm certain that if someone wanted to be a stickler they can complain and get a fine levied. I won't do that though. Instead I'll just post here. A pretty mediocre experience otherwise. I'll order more intelligently next time.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875287b87235b2d9:0x465f067a5ac30fc5"}

I pulled in, and noticed \ud83d\ude97 through was backed up outside the entrance boundary of the drive through about 5 or 6 cars so it was busy busy. I understand this. I parked, and walked in. There was only one lady and her daughter their waiting. She was acting very bothered like had been there forever.  I got a little worried, but I promised myself I was getting my mom this freaking \ud83c\udf83 blizzard that everyone is talking about because she loves \ud83c\udf83.  She is about to undergo surgery so want her happy \ud83d\ude0a.  Anyway I ask if she had been helped, and she said yes. I stood at the counter for the next,  oh I would say 8 minutes with not one hello or one moment. I'm in the industry \ud83d\ude42.  I could see that the 3 young men were crazy busy running back and forth making things. I just think acknowledging people is huge, mostly when they take the time to walk in and be face to face with you.  Anyway this ladies order comes up, and she pulls out her receipt because there was a discrepancy.  There had to be 50 things on that receipt.  At that point I would understand why her order would take well over 30min when your that busy. I dont really know how long it was. Anyway once she was helped. Owen came over, and asked if I had been helped yet. I said no, and he took my order. Very friendly. I had my 3 blizzards, and out the door within 3 minutes. He was a perfect example of turning my horrible review into 5 stars. Also it was how he handled the lady with her discrepancy that I watched. DQ lucky to have him, and prob has saved a few people the same thoughts of your company on these crazy busy times. It was around 8pm 10-14-20. He should get a little bonus check \ud83d\ude09 for doing something like this. Read my other reviews, and a lot of companies do not have someone that turned my bad review around. \ud83d\udc4d","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875288d80a32c19d:0x63d045544e3142a5"}

I got excited when we moved within a few miles of Dairy Queen and we went on Saturday to check it out. Big mistake. This is nothing like a Washington Dairy Queen! When we walked in, we saw a teenaged employee struggling with making a dipped cone. The manager saw what happened and he hard-core chewed her out in front of the customers waiting in line. A few minutes later we heard the manager and employee talking in the back and the poor girl had to offer to pay for the cone that she messed up on. Gee whiz, she made a mistake! But instead of trying to help her fix her mistake, the manager chewed her out and embarrassed her. The cashier who helped us was very friendly, I didn't catch her name but she was Asian. The tables were quite dirty and sticky. I wasn't given gravy for the toast in my chicken strip basket. The dipped cone was delicious and they made it after we were done with out main lunch. After reading other people's reviews, I can guess that the manager cuts corners here to save a few dollars a month in inventory. I wish the manager would realize that he'd have a lot more business if he treated his employees with respect, gave enough sauces, and kept his restaurant clean. Those simple things could get the place better reviews and more business.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875288d80a32c19d:0x63d045544e3142a5"}

So I called and spoke to the \u201cmanager\u201d and they told me they can\u2019t help me I have to talk to Lynn. So I stopped by because Lynn never is there and when he is no one will answer phone. My 2nd attempt I stopped by and the manager \u201cJanice\u201d was not willing to help me in any way and told me to talk to \u201cLynn\u201d So I called to talk to Lynn a 3rd time and \u201cDerick\u201d said he would write my name down and next time I can get free meal. Well I drove 15 mins to this DQ and the 4th attempt Janice refused to help me or do anything saying Lynn must tell her what to do. She speaks broken English and it was a lost cause dealing with her. So I ordered and paid for a meal that was promised to be free. This time the meal had a nice lovely hair in it. I\u2019m not sure if it was on purpose or just accident from poor sanitary practices but regardless a second meal was thrown away after eating a long brown hair. I called again and spoke to the lovely Janice who told me she can\u2019t help me call back to talk to Lynn. The 7th time Lynn is still MIA and I\u2019m beginning to think he is a made up person the employee\u2019s tell customers with complaints to call back and talk to imaginary Lynn because they don\u2019t want to deal with or handle customer complaints and issues. They don\u2019t and will not own their mistakes or accidents not even apologizing for the issue. They don\u2019t care if their customers are happy or not or if they even have customers. This DQ is run off the policy of lying to customers and dishonest practices and poor work ethics and unsanitary conditions they refuse to make any much needed changes. If you want to experience a good meal with no problems or issues that will ruin your appetite then don\u2019t go to this DQ!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875288d80a32c19d:0x63d045544e3142a5"}

They need to understand something. Your doors close at 9pm meaning customers can come in up until 9 and should be able to expect the same quality EVERY SINGLE TIME. My chicken was dry and rubbery, the steak was tough and flavorless. I'm mostly angry because I KNOW you are capable of producing good quality food and all of you on tonight's team just DECIDED that wasn't the priority. Shame on your GM for allowing such poor customer service. I can find another place that would appreciate me and MY time.

First of all pay before you eat is not a good model as I have not yet seen my food. I had a party of nine. First they told me it would be a wait. I asked how long the hostess said I don't know. I then asked so is it two hours or ten minutes? Another hostess stepped in and said about 15 to 20 minutes. I was fine with this. Ten minutes latter another party of nine came in and WAS SEATED. After brining this to the hostess attention they had no reason as to why this was done. After another twenty minutes of waiting we were seated. Our server was great. But the food was mediocre at best. One of our steak orders was given to the wrong table. All in all the service was poor except the one server. Also they did nothing to comp us for the mistake they made. Will not be going back.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8752859605306321:0xf311682917ac288c"}

So when we got there we ordered our food. Everything going as it should. I ordered a build your own pasta with Italian sausage. When they brought it out there was no Italian sausage. When they brought it out my wife was in the lady\u2019s room. I waited and finally got the attention of the waiter and told them. He brought it out promptly. Just after I started to eat my wife came back. After a few bites she had a weird look on her face. Then she had me try it. Something was off. Not sure what it was but there was something wrong with the dish. She had like three bites. We told the waiter and when they brought the check out we were confused. Then we realized that both dish\u2019s were waived off so it was like 8 dollars. The whole night the waiter was on top of it and served us. Our drinks were never low, and everything he could\u2019ve done he did. It\u2019s one of those things that you know is going to happen despite all the best efforts. They did everything they could to correct the problem. And my wife left not even hungry between the Cesar salad and the consistent bread they brought out through the evening.

The air in the restaurant was really smokey, like something had burned, but I don't know if this is just the result of the kitchen being open to the dining room. Then, possibly to clear the air a little, they propped open a door, with temps in the 30s, so it was really cold for half the meal. Service wasn't great. She seemed over loaded and couldn't keep things straight. My drink went without a refill until she brought the check, and even then it was quite a while before it came. She also brought the wrong drink the first time. She brought all but one of our dishes, then brought out all the food for the table next to ours, and then brought our last dish.

{"user_id":1.040780187e+20,"name":"Randi Tisdale","rating":1,"text":"This was our first and probably last experience with this restaurant. We ordered the premium family feast for five and received three pieces of burnt chicken parmesan and a bunch of spaghetti that looked like it was the leftovers from the day. For some reason there were some Penne pasta mixed in there and it was very dry. It included a caesar salad which I asked if I could upgrade to an Italian chopped salad for an extra fee but was told there are absolutely no substitutions. So I ordered an Italian chopped salad separately for $13.50 and what I received was a salad with a few pepperonis and some bacon bits. It had no vegetables in it whatsoever and I don't even remember it including bacon bits on the menu. Needless to say, we are extremely disappointed and definitely will not recommend this restaurant to anyone. If I were you, I would stick with Olive Garden. You really get  what you pay for there and they are more than happy to accommodate substitutions.","resp":{"time":1615991600959,"text":"Randi, thank you for your honest comments regarding your recent visit to Macaroni Grill.

We came from American Fork City to eat at The Cheese Cake Factory in Murray but they wouldn't let us reserve a time over the phone and when we came in the restaurant they told us it would take two hours to get us a group table. So we left, all 14 of us, and went to The Macaroni Grill. This place was very nice, clean, professional, and friendly. It's extremely important to me and many to be treated with hospitality and that's exactly what Romano's Macaroni Grill in Murray did.

Had some good experiences here before.\n\nWalked up to the host table to an absence of a host, just a waiter in the back of the seating section, and 4 tables with guests dining. The waiter was actively avoiding eye contact and any interaction, a young man with a beard. He walked around the tables, took a phone call, and finally crossed all the way from the South of the establishment to the East, clearly distancing himself from us and darting toward the wait station room to dispatch someone, anyone but himself, to help us. Please someone help us!\n\nSeveral minutes more passed and a nice older fella sat us and said our waiter would be right back.\n\nSeveral minutes more passed and the same nice gentleman came back and said he would be waiting on us after all and could he bring drinks? Yes, we of course said, an Ice Tea and a water.\n\nHe brought the oldest and hardest loaf of bread-ish thing to our table. I asked for a fresh loaf and he accommodated.\n\nThe main menu items from there were okay, or maybe okay+, but the service continued to depreciate. I asked for a box for my remainders and it simply never happened. No refill of our drinks, not once.\n\nNot a high-class experience despite Macaroni Grille trying to be a little more than the Olive Garden.\n\nStrong Pass. Sadly, this cool little Italian place has absolutely lost it's passion for service.Who Runs This Show?!?","resp":{"time":1584121031566,"text":"Aaron, thank you for your honest feedback on your recent visit to Macaroni Grill.

Unfortunately, we had reservations and were able to be seated rather quickly, but that is where the positive ended. We were seated at 530, but didn't get our food until 730. The bread was stale and there was no warning that the meal would be so delayed. Some of our food was overcooked, others barely warm. On top of this, when we asked for parmesan, they were out. Our waiter maybe visited the table twice during this whole time.

Thumbs up for that! First server was great. Thumbs up! I ordered food, tasted my chicken and chicken is half done - so it wasn't grilled properly. I asked them to grill it few more minutes. They brought that back - the plate was so hot I couldn't touch it and by that I knew it - they did not grill it, they only tried to \"cook\" it bit more by putting it in microwave or their warmer oven. Of course, chicken was exactly same as before (not cooked),  just to hot to eat. I returned that and ordered some ravioli with (apparently real cheese) and some butter squash. I never ate something so bad like this butter squash (trust me on this, never order that). Ok, so I decided I will eat my ravioli. Ravioli wasn't filled with real cheese. This is some creamy sauce that is supposed to have the same taste. So bad. I ate one, 5 were left. I asked them to box the leftovers for my son and to box ravioli with his meal. We came home , he wanted to eat - no spaghetti, and only 3 ravioli inside. The server that boxed that for us did not want to use 2 boxes and tried to \"fit\" everything in one. She did not have enough space for spaghetti or ravioli so she simply did not box it :-) :-) :-) I am giving 3 stars only because our first server was nice, and because soup was great. Maybe it was bad day for them, maybe it was only my meal that wasn't good, or maybe my standards are bit higher when it comes to food at the restaurant.

It was only my second time at this location so it's hard to know if my poor service experience was a one-time deal or if it's systemic. I am a bit unsure I like how they've changed the seating format. They previously had a combination of booths and tables. Now it's all open with no booths and all tables. It makes it seem like you're in a ballroom filled with tables. My wife liked it better. I am still not sure. It made it a more 'big city' packed-house kind of feel-- which is nice sometimes. Give it a try.\n\nThe food was, of course, great. I had the pizza this time and it was excellent; a nice melange of spices and medium crust. I love the bread they serve but wish that they had a choice of more than white bread. A wheat or some other wholegrain bread would be a nice option so that dinner is not just a white-flour-fest between the bread, white pasta, white-crust pizza, or other white-flour fare.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875289bb88b89195:0x7283acfcfd87341a"}

{"user_id":1.071731404e+20,"name":"Sarah Glines","rating":1,"text":"I read an article recently that said millennials are killing the food service industry. However, based on my experience at Macaroni Grill tonight I can tell you the industry is doing a pretty good job on its own.\n\nWe walked in and the restaurant was not very busy. Maybe 4 other groups were there with 2-4 people each. After being seated the server, who was very nice, took our orders immediately and poured out olive oil in which to dip bread. But there was no bread. In fact even after sitting for half an hour, there was still no bread or drinks. I had ordered a glass of wine which I understand can take a couple minutes if the bar is busy, but my companion had only ordered a soda.  We finally got his drink after 30 minutes, but mine took 45. Our food came out shortly thereafter, and the best word I can come up with to describe the food is \u201cmeh.\u201d  It wasn\u2019t bad, but it wasn\u2019t good, and it was way overpriced for what we got.  My companion ordered lasagna which was just lukewarm. He stated it tasted the exact same as frozen lasagna. I got the \u201csignature\u201d macaroni and cheese and it wasn\u2019t even as good as Velveeta Shells and Cheese.  It too was lukewarm and the pasta was very mushy. I paid extra for \u201ccrispy prosciutto\u201d and what I got was what looked like bacon bits from a jar. They were hard and tasted like burnt bits of bread.\n\nWith tip we paid close to $70. The poor quality food was not even close to being worth that. There are so many wonderful places in Salt Lake; don\u2019t waste your time here!","resp":{"time":1573231630598,"text":"Sarah, thank you for the candid feedback.

It has to do with the cleanliness, lack of general maintenance in customer facing areas, and super crammed seating.\n\nThe restrooms were about as clean as a poorly run gas station, old broken toilet seats that I didn\u2019t even dare touch... seriously disgusting. The whole restroom was in desperate need of a remodel!\n\nAbove the kitchen, is yellow painted walls and they appeared dirty with grease from all of the cooking. This may just need to be repainted or renovated, but it looked gross being right above everyone\u2019s food being cooked.\n\nThe tables were so close that the staff was having to move or bump chairs just trying to access their tables. I caught several people awkwardly trying not to lock eyes with me, because there was nothing to look at and people were all crammed in together.\n\nOverall, I think it was a good restaurant with good staff but the owners need to stop being so cheap on their customers and invest in their building, because it wasn\u2019t worth the price purely based on the venue.\n\nSide note, they had four different beers but they were all lagers...

It took them 60 min to bring us our order, they had no pinot grigio of any brand on hand, their fryer was down and couldnt provide any appetizers... for a large chain restaurant this was a complete fail... ***11\/14\/19 UPDATE*** The restaurant management company reached out to me to do their best to rectify what in all honesty, was a situation that was outside of their control. The Utah DABC was the culprit behind their lack of available wine, and understandably a novice employee dropped some plastic into their fryer which ruined the appliance. The company was ultra responsive to my concerns and contacted me right away to make things right. I will definitely go back and give them my business, based more on anything their proactive approach to address a single customers complaint. Thanks Romano's!!!","resp":{"time":1573503550410,"text":"Mario, thanks for the update. We look forward to welcoming you soon for a special meal."},"gmap_id":"0x875289bb88b89195:0x7283acfcfd87341a"}

This is a great place to enjoy family time out to eat. The table with paper and crayons have lead  us to create interesting master pieces, while not having technology distract us. As much as I like this place, the reason for not giving a 5 star review is for our food has come out room temperature multiple times the past year. The staff has been great about getting it back to the kitchen and back to our table in a timely manner. I am unsure why the food isn't always piping hot since most the time we are in not at prime hours. All in all we will be back, and it is one of our favorite Italian spots in town.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875289bb88b89195:0x7283acfcfd87341a"}

We order a few plates, and one of them was not prepare well, so of the members of our party decided she did not want to keep eating it, but wasn't sure about asking the waiter because it was her first time eating that specific plate. Everyone else was satisfied with their food. As we were ready to pay, the waiter, without being told anything, asked her if there was anything wrong with her food as she had barely touched it, she explained, and he immediately apologize for it, told her that if it wasn't to her liking they would prepare it again, solve the problem, and not charge her for the food.

At all. I mean, it was perfectly edible, but far from delicious.\n\nWhere they shine is their pasta. Penne Rustica is one of their better dishes.\n\nThey are pretty overpriced for what you get. While most of their other dishes that I've had are all fairly good, few (if any) are really fantastic and most are smallish. A recent caprese salad consisted of a few pieces of very bland tomatoes, a couple skimpy cuts of cheese and a very average tasting sauce\/glaze... and cost $10.\n\nI do appreciate that they list the calories of each dish to help guide your choices.

{"user_id":1.098613977e+20,"name":"Jill Young","rating":1,"text":"My husband and I went out for a date night. Dinner and a movie, just the two of us! We had a gift card so we decided to try the Romano's Macaroni Grill near the Fashion Place Mall. Well... it was NOT all we had hoped it would be. We thought it was going to be a nice place like Johnny Carinos, but the paper and crayons on top of the white table cloths told a different story. We got seated in the corner and waited... and waited... about 10 minutes before the manager brought some bread and took our drink orders. Then the waitress came by and introduced herself by writing her name in crayon on the table. :\/ While she was there the manager came with our drinks and we ordered an appetizer (disappointed that the stuffed mushrooms that were on the online menu had been removed). We waited... and after a while the waitress returned to take our order. Then things went downhill.... we finished the bread, and our drinks, and waited... and waited... 20 minutes later the waitress reappeared and brought water, and offered some more bread (apparently their \"strawberry lemonade from a mix\" doesn't get refills). No I didn't want more bread, where was our appetizer... only then did she tell us that there was going to be a delay.... The computers had gone down and all the tickets had been lost. So our meal order didn't get to the kitchen. Okay... well stuff happens  and surely they would be able to overcome this especially since she had written down our order at the table. (Wishful thinking) 15 minutes later the manager brings us our soup and salad. 5 minutes later the manager stops by with a $25 coupon for a future visit as an apology. A few minutes later the waitress stops by and asks if there is anything else missing.... well yes.... the appetizer we ordered. 10 minutes later the manager... they are out of that appetizer would we like something different. Sigh... no just our meals.  Manager returns with our food   (don't see the waitress again) and tells us they will be on the house. My meal is burnt and my husband's is cold. Not really up to having the kitchen do it over when we aren't paying anyway so we eat what we can. The manager returns and I show him my burnt mushrooms. :( He offers dessert and we order chocolate cake.... the cake comes and it is bitter and the ganache has separated. We finish our meal and leave. At least we didn't pay and NO we won't be back. Worst dinner experience ever!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875289bb88b89195:0x7283acfcfd87341a"}

Got to knew that he's the owner at the end as he explained the poor customer service that time. I can't believe his wife chose to go to the gym that help him in the family business.

Since a couple of my Persian restaurant stops in Utah have gone out of business, it was nice to finally find another Persian place at the recommendation of a friend.\n\nThe Chicken Kabob Koobideh wasn't my favorite (least favorite I've ever had) so I will be substituting with the Sultani on future visits. I loooove the blackened tomatoes that come with these sort of dishes. Mine was a little too blackened, but I still ate it.\n\nThese are by no means a no-go for me.

I guess I should thank them for their slow decline in quality, since it means I eat less fast food now. 2 years ago, this used to be the best Burger King I had ever tried in my many years throughout different states. My drive thru server was super friendly and always got every order right, my fries were always piping hot and fresh. Her name was Maria- I remember because she actually recognized me and asked after my little dog every time he wasn't with me in the car. I don't know what happened to this location, but those days are long gone. My orders are wrong at least 40% of the time. I've had to ask for napkins 9 of the last 10 times I've come, because they forget to put them in. My fries are always old, dry, and cold now. The sandwiches taste like they've been under the heat lamp for way too long. You'd think all the time they save by not cooking something fresh and tasty would at least make it fast, but oh no. I sit for long periods of time in the drive-thru, often with more than one car pulled forward and waiting for their order to be filled and brought out. This is a sad decline and I now go more out of my way for any fast food lunches.

Foods going to be fast, hot, and I can dine in with my husband with no worries of the staff being obnoxious\u201d . Clearly I was wrong. I had to wipe my own table. Because all the other ones had crumbs or ketchup on it, with that much staff you would THINK they would have atleast one person kind of spot cleaning and doing stuff where the customers eat. Wrong. I then waited almost 10 minutes for my food. Kind of not a big deal, our order was fairly large. The manager then called the number of our order as if he had been calling it for 5 minutes with no response from us. We were the only table in there, and I would\u2019ve heard him because I was listening for it the whole time. Our food was mediocre at best. My burger tasted old, my other burger (yes I\u2019m heavy) had a ton of mustard on it for such a small burger.  Oh well. The fries were hot and just the right amount of salt. The chicken nuggets were OLD as can be. I then see three teenager employees go outside where then the manager stepped outside and you could see he was clearly reprimanding them. Awesome.  But not a minute later he was coming out of the office laughing loudly and swearin with them.  They were Screaming and yelling in the back as if someone was dying.   Then 5 more minutes go by and the manager and about 6 employees go outside to what I assume, was to smoke. I went up to the front to receive some sauce for my chicken nuggets that I didn\u2019t get. Nobody could help me. So I just threw them away, because some sauce would\u2019ve made the old nuggets taste a little better.   That manager on shift was clearly not in control of his shift or employees and also clearly didn\u2019t care about what was going on.

Did the 2 for 25 deal. Ordered chips and salsa as well as the onion petals for appetizers. All was good.\nThe problem was that our drinks sat empty almost the whole visit. The little cup of sauce they bring for the onions was no where near enough so I asked for more. The problem there was i had to ask 3 times and 2 different people to get it. The service was just off. Same with ordering more salsa, had to ask twice and 2 different people to get it. It bothers me when I pay for a drink and then just have to sit there and look at my empty cup.\nI'll give it another try if I'm back in the area, but if service is the same it goes to 2 stars and I won't be back.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875287c7b9712803:0xd49b154631441d4d"}

Expensive alcohol, overrated food, etc, etc.\n\nMy wife and I were seated at the bar, ordered drinks and began looking at the menu. It was a full 45 minutes before we could even place our meal orders. Then, it took a further 90 minutes to receive our food, 1 appetizer, 1 meal to share. We counted; there were 6 couples that arrived after us that were able to order before us, get their food sooner, eat, and leave before we got our food. For reference, half of the tables were completely vacant. There wasn't a wait in the restaurant.\n\nOur server was then very rude when we asked if there might be a problem in getting our order placed, or whether the kitchen has begun working on our meal. We ended up spending nearly 3 hours here just to eat  hips and salsa, and very very underdone chicken.\n\nDon't waste your time here.

Been going there for 8 years but the food has declined too much. The fajitas are still very good but that's about it. And a 20 something manager with a ring in her nose and several exposed tattoos? Nothing wrong with either but this public restaurant is not the place.","resp":{"time":1557298253318,"text":"Hey Bill, thanks for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

It's kind of hard to mess up carne asada tacos honestly. This place, just like most other taco carts, is pretty good. They even have rice and beans which is a staple I see often lost on other carts. I feel the best way to judge a taco cart isn't even on their tacos or burritos, but on the beauty of their salsa coolers. This one was unique in that they had two different kinds of grilled onions, grilled jalapenos, and of course the staples of cabbage, pico de gallo, and 4 salsas in squeeze bottles. I went for the green one and it was pleasantly spicy. Spicier than I anticipated and I was appreciative of that. Also strategically located next to a soccer supply store. So leave work, come grab a taco and eat it standing up in a parking lot outside. It's the Mexican\/American dream.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875288feefd88bf5:0xb2f6047dcc69743c"}

Even with the grand opening this week, the lines moved quickly and our food was hot and fresh. Customer service gets an A+ too. I would avoid the drive through for now and either dine-in or order on the app. I\u2019m so glad they came to Utah!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875285ac56502cb1:0x26a0dfaffa88c87e"}

The store has a 2 star average rating and they post the same response to all low reviews asking for time, store location, etc. Obviously they can just see what store is being rated to know the store location.\n\nSecond, I wrote this review while I was sitting at the store. It actually got worse after I posted... the young lady at the counter had me sign for an order and then gave that order to someone else. It turns out that my order was not even made. Why she had me sign for someone else's order is beyond me. However I would guess lack of proper training and management.","resp":{"time":1575406281612,"text":"Hi Bryan, we're sorry to hear that you had a poor experience when ordering from us recently.

I ordered pizza around 8pm one night and an hour and a half had passed and I heard nothing from them and my pizza wasnt delivered. I called the store to see what\u2019s going on and they said they couldn\u2019t send the driver because the address I provided wouldn\u2019t pull up on the GPS and for the driver\u2019s safety they couldn\u2019t send him. I asked them why no one called to get a better address OUT OF COURTESY SINCE THEY ALREADY CHARGED ME and they didn\u2019t have an answer for me. They just decided not to deliver my pizza and take my money. They said they\u2019d refund my money, but they didn\u2019t until I called them TWO more times after I didn\u2019t see the money in my account after two weeks. The other time I ordered from them I ordered the pizza around 8:30pm. Estimated time of delivery was in 30 minutes. I waited almost an hour and my siblings were already falling asleep on an empty stomach. I called to get an estimated time and told them it\u2019s been over an hour I\u2019ve waited for my pizza. They said the delivery guy just left the store and was on his way and he\u2019d be there in 20 minutes (even though I live no more than 8 minutes from the store). I waited 20 minutes and still NO sign of the delivery guy. My family was hungry and I had no time to wait around for a pizza I was unsure was going to show up so I left and got in n out for my family. It was at that moment they started blowing up my phone with calls because the delivery guy was now there.

{"user_id":1.175295171e+20,"name":"John smith","rating":1,"text":"I love Panda Express food. Unfortunately, this location was very unprepared and slow, which gave me a negative overall experience. I was behind just one other person at around 5:00pm. I ordered a 2 entree of orange chicken with fried rice. The fried rice was empty, and the orange chicken was as good as empty. They hadn't even started preparing a new batch of fried rice, nor orange chicken, until I was ordering it. The person in front of me wanted fried rice too, so technically that should have sparked the making of the fried rice. Either way, it was probably a minute or two after I ordered that the chef in the back actually started preparing to make some fried rice. Looked like he was still cleaning out the wok first. And it wasn't until probably 5 minutes later that it looked like they started preparing a new batch of orange chicken. I ended up waiting about 15 or 20 minutes for the simplest order possible at Panda Express - fried rice and orange chicken - easily their most popular menu item. It baffles me that they hadn't even started preparing a new batch of fried rice or orange chicken until the woman in front of me and myself ordered food...at 5:00pm...on a weekend... which all restaurants should know is the start of the dinner time rush. I've never had to wait so long at Panda Express in my life, when I was just the 2nd person in line. I still love Panda Express as a whole, but my experience here makes me want to avoid this location at all costs.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875287c8a2a2bb5f:0xf2bc96bb6f1c62fd"}

No one prepping food should have to ask where prep gloves are! Then mid-order she helped people on cashier (which is fine), touched money, coughed, and went to fill my pretzels bites. I had to ask twice for her to put gloves on AGAIN. Then the manager walked in and I complained about the unsanitary food prep. He was appalled that I wanted people wearing gloves who were serving my pretzel bites and insisted that it's unnecessary, multiple times!

The juice and horseradish were freshly made and were the perfect compliment to the meal.  The caprese appetizer and sorbet for a palette cleanse were delightful and the cheesecake with berry compote was rich and tickled the taste buds.

Manifestations- A tribute to Edgar Allan Poe, a fabulous five course meal and an electric, superb magic show with Paul Draper was the line up of the evening. Let me tell you that my friend and I both thought this whole experience was one of the best ever! If I could give it more stars, I would. The atmosphere is elegant, spooky, detailed and very intimate.\nThe service was exceptional. Our \"guides\" for the evening were a maid, Katie and a butler, Drew. They were literally there to take care of our every need. They were both perfect in their positions. Every single guest felt\u00a0 special, taken care of and important. I've never had better service, ever, period.\nWe started out with an appetizer of bacon wrapped dates that were to die for! Then we had a lovely salad with pickled beets, cranberries and a bunch of other yummy stuff. Next was the \"palate cleanser\" of blackberry sorbet with sugar on the rim. It was the perfect amount of sweet and tangy! Next up was the main course. My bff chose the prime rib and I chose the Cornish hen. Both dishes were tender, perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious. Finally we had a chocolate mousse\/cake that was rich, chocolatey and melted in your mouth. There were blueberries and dried papaya on top that just enriched the chocolate flavors. During each course we would listen to a dramatic reading of something by Edgar Allan Poe.\nIf all of that wasn't enough, after our meal we were enchanted by award winning magician & mentalist Paul Draper. He is spectacularly talented, charming, funny and entertaining. I even got to help him during his performance and I still have no idea how he did what he did! Everyone was in awe. I just want everyone to know how amazing this experience is. It was way above and beyond our expectations.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8752898eca444a6d:0x6f3dc824b6110b2f"}

The four guests you reference were provided masks by us. They wore their masks throughout the evening with the exception of while they were eating. They were appropriately distanced from you and all others all evening. When you were first seated it was brought to my attention you were uncomfortable with our modified dining room because there was not plexiglass down the center of the table. Our modified dining room distances diners seated face to face at least 7 feet and up to 10 feet away from each other. I met you in the lobby where I actually offered you and your party a full refund and actually asked you to leave knowing nothing would make you happy.  You declined my offer. Throughout dinner you pointed to several people and mask shamed them.  Our server did repeatedly ask the group to keep their masks on. You and others in your group are elderly and high risk. Our website encourages such individuals to come later when the risk is less. You insulted everyone who\u2019s views are different than yours, calling those who live here rednecks. As your party left the young lady with you apologized for your behavior as she exited. We appreciate your concern however unfounded."},"gmap_id":"0x8752898eca444a6d:0x6f3dc824b6110b2f"}

Seemed like a missed opportunity.  The magician showed a few card tricks most of which I have seen before and know how they are done so that wasn't as impressive as I would have liked.

His illusions were mainly classic standbys, but executed extremely well. You can tell he loves the art. Pricing does make this a rare treat, but definitely follow them on Facebook or join their mailing list for frequent discounts. When we went, it was half off, making it a much better proposition.

Since the room is small, holds just 30 people, Docc was right there with us, which is a fresh experience from attending performances in a huge hall.

I can't believe we drove past this place so many times without stopping. Friendly staff, great atmosphere, and the best Hawaiian food we've ever had. Even the other customers are friendly; there are good vibes all around!\n\nYes, you heard me correctly. This is better than the food we had in Hawaii!\n\nThe poke was unbelievably fresh and we learned they fly their fish in, instead of relying on local, land-locked fish markets where everything is a few days old. There is an incredible amount of love and care put into every dish, and the flavors are unreal! This food is absolutely packed with flavor!! The sauces are rich and delightful (and made in house!). The kimchi is to die for (I ate an entire order of it in one sitting). All of their grilled meats have an amazing, barbecue, charred flavor that is so reminiscent of the best Hawaiian barbecue places in Honolulu. I can't decide on whether my favorite dish was the poke, fried chicken, or pork nachos, but you really cannot go wrong with whatever you choose here!\n\nThis meal took us right back to the islands and we couldn't be more grateful for the food and the service provided.

{"user_id":1.15838175e+20,"name":"Rob Rivera","rating":4,"text":"4 stars because (most of) the food is fantastic, but I'm ambivalent about the service.\n\nIf you are anything like me, one of the most annoying things a food place can do is not publish their menu. It's not even on their website... Not showing prices comes second. Menu as of June 2019 attached below.\n\nAs for the food, the prices seem... fair. What they lack in quantity they make up for in quality. I tried the steak poke, the furikake chicken and the lilikoi pulehu pork; all delicious.\n\nThe chicken was like a gourmet level of the usual katsu you find at island fare. The thin tempura coating absorbs the sauce perfectly and gives it a sweet, flaky texture that both crisps and melts in your mouth.\n\nThe pork is grilled from fine cuts of meat and not the usual saucy shredded variety. The lemon ponzu that comes with the poke is to die for.\n\nThe rice is standard - sticky and dries quickly. The \"Crack Mac\" is also conventional except for the little bits of bacon sprinkled on them. The kimchi was a little flat and bitter and didn't have that fermented sour sizzle I like.\n\nSo, the meats are amazing and easily the best island food I've had in Utah. The sides are... fine.\n\nAll that said, the menu does not mention what the ocean salad is (or that it is apparently $4 extra??) and neither did the cashier until I had already paid and asked about the price. Supposedly it is a seaweed salad of some kind?\n\nThey don't give you an itemized receipt that shows what cost what either. I may have imagined it, but I also got the sense that the cashier was getting vexed over my questions and fussing over wanting to know what exactly I was paying for. There was a bit of a wait also but I'll blame that on my 7 item order.\n\nI want to give this 3 stars but I don't feel that would be fair to the whichever master chefs were performing such magical meat feats. I might try going back once more to try some of the other meats... hopefully it was just an off day and the service will be better next time.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8752876bc735183b:0x3656015d8fd3a4ef"}

Second, the food they had sold as their best items were pretty underwhelming, especially for the price.  The teriyaki chicken, for which they lauded the sauce, was missing the sauce.  But wait, there it is, that runny stuff covering the plate that\u2019s in the salad, the edamame, and the rice but not on the chicken. The greens were warm (unsettling) and undressed, the edamame was ice cold and over dressed, and the chicken was dried out and pretty flavorless.  I can\u2019t figure out what took so long with only three orders in front of ours.\n\nMy wife got the poke nachos, which were just ok.  The chips were greasy AF and the fish tasted not so fresh.  She\u2019s currently nursing indigestion.\n\nIt\u2019s also odd that everything comes on these tiny wood plates, so for $12, I got six cents of greens, 15 cents of edamame, and four cents of rice along with probably $2 of dried out chicken packed into a tiny plate.\n\nFor $9 or less at Mo Betta, the chicken was better and there was more of it, the sauces stick to the chicken, i don\u2019t leave hungry or unsatisfied, and I spent 30% less for it.\n\nUpdate: I went to Mo Betta today and was much more satisfied with what I got for what I paid.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8752876bc735183b:0x3656015d8fd3a4ef"}

I believe they should focus in on the Thai end of their menu (as their name is Thai Basil) and ditch the Vietnamese and Chinese menu, because they're not very good at any of the above. With both my visit a year ago, and my takeout order today, everyone else I was with seemed to have the same negative feelings.\n\nEdit: Downgrading my review from 2\/5 Stars to 1\/5 Stars. My employer ordered the whole office food from Thai Basil this week (July 2018). Despite my past feelings of this place, free lunch is free lunch. Unfortunately it was just as terrible as ever. One thing many reviews like about this place is the diversity of the menu, diversity isn't a good thing when they've not mastered a single thing on their menu.

The place looked clean-esque on the surface but after the 20 minutes it took to get my food I noticed more and more nastiness. Two other customers came in and the young man working the register joined them outside for a minute after some hushed conversation. Were I a betting man I would bet that some illicit goods were exchanged. Well after that exchange the two \"customers\" disappeared into the bathroom. Everyone on shift that night looked vaguely like they smelled of rotten cabbage, and though a few other employees seemed to be aware of the deal between the employee and the two unwashed customers (which I am fairly sure included a dalliance in the women's bathroom ) Nobody seemed to care.\n\nThe possible drug deal and Possible prostitution could just be considered a hazard of going to a taco bell in a mostly abandoned section of a strip mall but the worst part of it all. After 20 minutes to get the food, it was cold. And they were all out of mild sauce.

If it starts bad chances are that it is just the beginning. We all know that!!\n\nExpect prices to be apparently affordable but they are far from reasonable.\n\nCalifornia rolls, we all know they're the less expensive but this place make them tasteless and super tiny.\n\nVegas, Sunset, Dragon and a number of rolls we ordered were small in size at a Sapa or Takashi price. Our check was over $90 and at the end we were far from being happy with the whole experience.\n\nI think that food portion and quality should go right in line with wath you pay.\n\nIf you enjoy \"elevator music\" type and being played very loud you may love this place regardless of service and food quality.\n\nMy advise to you is to read my review and others starting with the ones with only 1 or 2 starts and learn from our experience before you make a decision. And that goes to every place you visit.\n\nI read other reviews about this place and I agree that it might be under new management.

So my salad never comes and my steak is cooked through and through and my wifes steak is missing the shrimp from the top.  I mention the salad and the waitress says she'll be back and then we don't see her for forever.  I asked her to redo the steak (which I never do) and they finally got that right and my salad still hasn't shown up...She brings us the bill and when we ask for a box I mention to her again that my salad still hasn't come.

We ordered online from South Jordan to pick up in the Riverton store, 45 minute round trip. When we got home, we were disappointed to realize that we were given a chicken sandwich instead of the veggie burger, which went directly into the garbage since we don't eat meat.  Called the store to aske for a refund or Door Dash delivery of the correct order and I was basically told that I was lying because they remembered making the veggie burger.  I was very polite throughout the entire conversation.  The employee hung up on me.  The sweet potato bites were good but not worth the $30, nearly an hour drive, the hassle of having to make a phone call, being called a liar, and then figuring out something else to eat for dinner.  We won't be back.","resp":{"time":1622344660619,"text":"Hello Christian. We are very sorry that this was your experience.

My rice bowl had so many peppercorns I had to take breaks, avoid them, and eventually pick them out.

My wife and I are massive health freaks and are very grateful to have another place we can go to eat (besides chipotle).  Among the things that impressed us was the date sweetened \u201cnice\u201d cream made with coconut milk, the salad dressings made with high quality olive oils and the gluten-free cheese rolls that came free with entree (all of which are similarly natural and wholesome).\n\nWe got there before the dinner rush and the worker bent over backwards to acquaint us (let us sample each of the dressings).  I got the $10 Dream chicken salad with cashew dressing which was delicious and sizable.  My only issue was when I asked for avocado and feta cheese, I wasn\u2019t told they\u2019d be extra and my bill raised to over $14 (the guy knew we were new and should\u2019ve mentioned the extra charge).  Also, like others have said, the crew doesn't seem highly trained (compiling my bowl took 3 times longer than it should have) and had thick accents,  but they are nice.

It was a completely empty in there. The 2 men working there acted very confused when we showed up and I said we ordered online. After 5 minutes of waiting he handed us our food, good thing is everything we ordered was there and accounted for. Bad thing is we ate it. I had the Meat plate, with pulled pork, Texas style brisket, a \"buttery\" roll, Mac and cheese and Coleslaw. Mac and cheese was good just standard restaurant Mac and cheese. The coleslaw was actually pretty good, the \"buttered\" roll was NOT buttered and was honestly stale, my biggest mistake was eating the meat. The pulled pork looked dry and the brisket was very discolored. (It had that green\/pink tint to it that meat gets after being set out for too long not under the correct temperature) so I didn't eat much of that and I had to SMOTHER the meats in the original BBQ sauce to make both the meats okay. Hours after we finished our to go dinner my stomach has been upset all night, not handling the food well at all. Will not be going here in the future, especially its over priced to eat food that will end up making you sick all night. Would you like to pay $30 to be sick? I didn't think so. I'd rather pay 20 more dollars to go sit down at Famous daves, or R & R barbecue.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875286342d98b2fd:0xd349b37086aafa81"}

The last observation was that they were out of the nacho cheese Doritos shell which was the only thing that our customer had ordered. (The 2 star rating was made by my girlfriend.

After making our selection, it took about a good fifteen minutes for them to actually provide our food.  By that time, I'd downed about three refills of Baja Blast.  I also noticed a young man cleaning the tables.  I should have timed him, because it honestly felt like he took 10 minutes on each table, and he didn't even clean all of them, nor the one that was behind us that had scattered cheese and a cup.\n\nPOINTERS\/PERKS - 1\nTurn around go out the door and find another Taco Bell, and steer clear of the restrooms.

I will definitely come back here again if I find myself in West Jordan again in the future.\n\nLOCATION\nIn a strip mall near the dollar store.  I'm sure they get reasonable visits.\n\nPRICE\nThe price was comparable to any other dine-in restaurant.  We ordered three different entrees which totaled to about $25.  I did think the price for a soft drink was a little steep ($2), but other than that no complaints about the prices.\n\nPRODUCT\/SERVICE\nThe food was delicious.  I ordered the C1 Com Ga and enjoyed it.  The serving size was reasonable for the price.  The service was also great.\n\nEMPLOYEES\nWe were served by a young man at the register which was rather polite and patient with us as we tried to figure out what we wanted to eat.

I was going to place an order online, but when I started to place it, around 7:40 pm, it said it wouldn't be ready until 8:06 pm. I figured I'd risk the wait & try the drive through. I was ordering for 3 people, so 3 of the \"bigger plates\". On one of the orders, orange chicken was supposed to be in it, but we got teriyaki chicken instead & that doesn't even compare to orange chicken in any way, shape or form. Another of our orders was supposed to have the 3rd item be 2 veggie egg rolls, but those were completely missing, even though I was charged for them. Oddly enough though, the receipt was mostly correct. But instead of the additional 2 sides of cream cheese rangoons I ordered being put on the receipt, they put down \"chicken egg rolls\" which yes, the price is the same, but if the receipt isn't right, how can my order ever be correct>\n\nBefore getting home & realizing we were missing pieces of the order & that the order was partially wrong, I was surprised at how fast the drive through was, which is great if your order is right. The first bag of food was bagged fine, but the second bag I was handed had the takeout boxes put into the bag on their sides and even handed to me on their sides, leaving the food leaking everywhere. That in itself sucks. but was made worse cause this was the bag that had cutlery, soy sauce, fortune cookies & my receipt so everything was sticky.\n\nIn general the food was actually really good, it was all hot & seemed to be fresh, but there is MUCH work to be done on how they put food in bags as well as making sure the receipt is correct, so that orders stay correct. Attention to correct orders in general needs work. This is a location that works great for us & we will probably visit again but if the ordering & packaging is this bad again, we will go out of our way to try a different location.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875285e286e601e1:0x7b50e78c9828959c"}

The last four times I have gone, they have forgotten something, given me the wrong thing, and mixed up the different orders. One or two times, I understand mistakes happen. But this is just getting ridiculous. There is a girl who works there at night who needs to get a new job somewhere else. She cuts you off while you're talking, she shoves your bag out of the window so quickly and walks off without even acknowledging you.

They don't give you as much at this location for the side or entrees as they do at other locations. Which for the price, is partly why the low rating. They didn't have what my boyfriend originally planned on getting for his entree, which was the Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Pork. He was shocked and highly disappointed, but ended up liking what he chose.

When you walk in, there is a distinct marked off area where the line should start and end using metal railing. The chairs are metal and inside the building it's pretty cold, so while I'm eating my cold ice cream sandwich, I'm freezing... I think they should invest in outside seating for people who want to sit out in the sun while eating their cold, delicious ice cream.\n\nHigh up on the wall there is a board full of choices and flavors. My boyfriend and I always go for the donut ice cream sandwiches. We switch flavors every time we go, but a couple of our favorites are the Bear Batter, Mint Chip, and the Strawberry Cheesecake. We, also, sometimes add Fruity Pebbles to our order. Our donut sandwiches are always topped off with sugar and some kind of blue syrup.\n\nI'm actually not a big fan of ice cream sandwiches and I'm not much of a sweet tooth either, so I was a little skeptical about trying the place out, but in the end I'm glad I did. I enjoy donut ice cream sandwiches a lot more than cookie ice cream sandwiches (especially the ones you can buy at the store), and Baked Bear was able to give me a taste of it before I threw the whole idea away.

It's not your typical place to just stop in whenever. We did so and instead of turning us away they made us pay for an entrance fee, gave us the pat down (this was confusing for a bar in Murray. Maybe they have issues with people bringing guns in and knives? It seemed a little much though). After that they told us they didn't have a table for us immediately, as most were reserved. They shuffled us around to a few tables here and there until they got us to a bigger table. Not a fun experience in that regard. Once at the table it was nice to hang out and have some Huka. Most people\/groups stay there for quite a bit or even the whole night. So it's best to reserve before hand because you may not have a good experience otherwise.

My wife place our order while I went and got a grilled cheese sandwhich elsewhere.  There was two people that placed an order before us.  Our order took around 25 minutes, and when I got it, the employee sheepishly admitted that she had accidentally given my order to the oversized, elderly woman in the motorized wheelchair.  She politely suggested that she make my order, but I refused with the thought of waiting another 20+ minutes for my order.  The experience wouldn't have been bad, if they would have had more than just one employee working.

Weave found the carne asada to be our favorite meat. We order the carne asada burrito, which comes with rice, beans and meat. She then hands you the burrito opened on the plate and you add any of the toppings you want that are in the cooler. You hand back the burrito and she adds cheese and closes it for you. Each burrito is $7, and they are huge. My husband and I usually just  share one because they are so gigantic. They have 4 different sauces and a separate cooler with all kinds of drinks from soda to kids juices. We have gone various times and only one time we encountered the girl at the stand who was so rude, it was as if she was doing you the greatest favor in the world to be serving you. She looked in real pain to be working that night. But all the other times the girls are fenomenal. I just can't recommend enough this taco stand. There is no outdoor seating. There are 2 flower bed wood benches that one can sit on but they are not very big. We have gone some nights when it is really crowded and we've had to eat in our car.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x875289b2f0328ff9:0x3215b553aab6efef"}

A little bland, lacking some flavor, and majorly lacking in some variety of textures. Kind of a big mush mess.

We usually go with the white bread or honey whole wheat. Each loaf is a little over $5. The best part is the sample bread they give to everyone in your party, even if u just bought 1 loaf. There are usually 5 or more options. The pieces are generous. They have butter and honey you can spread on your sample and enjoy a little piece of heaven. They also make sandwiches with their delicious bread each one about $7.50 or more. The employees are usually highschool girls and they are really nice and polite to everyone.","resp":{"time":1521741550924,"text":"Thank You for coming to Great Harvest Draper!

Sadly this is not it.  I got the dinner orders of kung pao chicken and beef & broccoli.  The kung pao chicken dish was 85% zucchini and texture\/flavors were off.  I eat a lot of kung pao chicken and this one was in a category all its own (and not in a good way).  The beef and broccoli was lacking the depth of flavor that you usually get from wok cooking and it was way too salty. I was very hungry and struggled to put this food away--it's the sort of thing that makes you lose your appetite while eating it.  The restaurant had 1 table of people there during dinner rush, so I should have taken that as a bad sign and walked away.  The positive reviews for this place are clearly from the Utahns with bland tastebuds & low expectations for Chinese food.

But I try not to be that person. So I just let it be. I've had dozens of orders from this place that went smoothly.... tonight's was rough but, it happens.\n\nSo, our pizza was due at 9:03 or so. It showed up around 10. My kids were hungry, I was tired, but when I looked outside I realized: it was snowing, it's friday night, I'm sure they're just busy. I intended to pay with cash so if it didn't show up, hey, there's always Mac n cheese right?\n\nWell, about 10 pm the pizza showed up. WITH an EXTRA cheese pizza (which is my son's favorite but I always make him pick off the toppings from whatever we get, cuz I'm not about to buy a whole pizza for both of my kids lol)\n\nSo boom. I'm not about to complain. I already got a free pizza out of this deal.\n\nA few minutes later, I get a promotional email (cuz I'm part of their rewards thingy) from dominos for a free pizza next week. Sweet! Two free pizzas\n\nTHEN like an hour or two later I get ANOTHER email \"pizzapologizing\" (they're so creative) for the delivery tonight and an offer for YET ANOTHER free pizza OR 50% off my next order.\n\nI mean, come on. What company reaches out to you, without you having to complain and throw a fit, and ends up setting you up with THREE free pizzas. Freakin score.\n\nOn that note, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have to start working out if they keep hooking it up like this \ud83d\ude02 LOL.\n\nBut anyways high five to y'all's team tonight.

They are amazing!!!! Today I did a carry out, I had to sit 8-10 min which was fine by me. The problem walking into the store with seeing what I saw this evening, was not a good look on your store. One gentleman with gray hair was eating in the back, set down his food to come help me. I then asked him politely to wash his hands before he grabbed my pizza. It still wasn't out the oven even though he told me he'd wash his hands before. Then as I'm waiting for my food to be done, your team had another member who was tall with dark hair that looked scruffy and was eating by the making station. I was not happy seeing this. I did speak to the manager but I want to make the complaint so this team member doesn't do it again. I work at sport clips...even if I had a client right after eating, I wash my hands..even if I smoke I wash my hands before cutting someone's hair. I don't even handle food and I am sure that my fingers are clean before dealing with clients. This upsets me because I used to work at Quiznos before they closed where Greek suvalaki is...I know that washing hands is a priority. I feel you guys must have a break room for employees to eat..so why are they eating on the floor??? I know the assistant or manager was young..and I know being young and in that position can be hard to confront another employee, this does need to be handled in the right way though. I don't feel comfortable ordering delivery now due to seeing that and not knowing if employees are eating while making my food. Very unsettling. Please be sure your employees know how important it is to eat in the break room off of the floor and out of sight of clientele or you will lose the clientel who sees you every month.
