The decor is absolutely beautiful inside and has this nice vibe which I can respect. I ordered a Mojito and it was terrible. I ordered the souvenir drink and no souvenir cup to take. Drinks were more ice than actual drink, but I guess I should have expected that. For my food I ordered the Vaca Frita and there was alot of vaca, but the flavor wasn't fully there. Additionally, I ordered the Cuban Fried Rice and the lechon had barely any flavor. Overall, I spent $100 and I felt I could have kept $85 of it.

We didnt eat all of our food and we end up paying and went to the front and ask to speak with the owner and said they were not present, the food was not good at all, I ask for a torta and on the memu said it came with  avocado amd I check and their was no avocado amd ask the server and she brought me guacamole instead which is totally different taste.

It is nowhere close to authentic jerk chicken and has almost no heat\/spice level on top of that... So if you want tasty chargrilled Jamaican spice accented chicken, go for it.

The beef patty was one of the most delicious patties I've ever had... Perfect spicyness level, no grizzle.

I tell him that I will pack it and print a label myself, & ask again to see the box list.  He refuses to give me the list while explaining why I need the $20 \"laptop\" box. I told him that I ship over $100k of electronics annually & I only need the boxes that I choose from the box list.  He then replies that this box list is nonexistent.  I reply that I have seen it several times & asked the other employee (who had been tuning in the entire time).  She quickly reaches directly in front of this jerk & pulls out this coveted box list.  I pick the boxes that I need, she gets them & rings me up.  The price is almost twice as much as the cost on the box list and she says, \"our prices have changed.\"  BS. I said nevermind & walked away.  It's so funny how they try & cheat you to pay their inflated prices for whatever services they provide & when that doesn't work, they make up rules & price changes on the spot. I can only imagine how they rip off people who are ignorant to their methods.  They totally would have ripped someone like my mom off...","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569ff7eded4669:0xa7fc8dd9ad5b1b24"}

I called the restaurant to complain, and the call taker, his manager, and then the kitchen manager all said it was to be expected from food delivery and blamed it on DoorDash. You can tell Capishe uses quality ingredients but do not order their food via delivery, and if you do ever have a problem with their food, don't expect them to make it right.

We understand that our customers have busy lives and don't always have the availability to come back to the boutique within 3 days. Our policy only requires that the customer contacts us within 3 days to inform us of any issues for a fix, at which point the customer can come in to get the repair done whenever their schedule permits. We aim to please our customers and it is very disappointing when we fail to do so. We would like the opportunity to improve any issues you may had with your previous visit and to earn back your business.

They had a great variety of music playing. The decor was nice as well they had  pictures of people on the wall from previous generations which I thought was cute & unique.\n\nWhen it was time to leave the bill was a bit of a surprise for our three drinks it was $48 .

Here's how my experience went: the location is spotless and the seafood on display is beautiful. The available catches are displayed on a large menu but WITHOUT PRICES, although there's an area to display them. That should have been my clue, but I can be clueless.\n\nI ordered 1.22 lbs of halibut and a half pound of ceviche featuring octopus. My bill was $95!!! That's 58.99 per pound for the halibut and $39.88 per pound for the ceviche. All had been cut and packaged so I couldn't back out.\n\nWhile I'm sure this will be the best and most conscionable choice, I had a really hard time explaining the expense to my better half.

We got our drinks fairly quickly so I thought things were going well. We ordered several apps in the 1st quarter, by the 3rd quarter we still had no food. We ordered some bottles thinking surely if they see how much money we plan to drop then they'll make sure we get great service. It took 1.5hrs to get the appetizers and we were told the server dropped the tray so the whole order was re-fired. The server was apologetic and said they'll adjust the bill in light of the wait.\nThe food was ok, the sliders were decent, the lettuce wraps were wilted and the wings were lukewarm.\nWhen I got the bill at the end of the night the manager took off $1.74 ....

Also, Parking sucks.\n\nMy Response to your reply:\nThere is a cost to having lights on in your and water in your toilet but I was not charged for those things. They are considered a cost of doing business. I did not use your computer therefore no disclaimer was displayed to me. Your staff used your computer to print a label for a package that I was shipping with you. That minor $3.22 to print a shipping label was as cost you should have absorbed as a cost of sending my pacakege. FedEx does not charge me for labels, boxes, envelops, zipties, etc. That is why I usually go with them. Additionally, I was shopping back an item that was sent to me over a year ago for factory repairs. That is a tad bit long to keep an Amazon box. There were no parking spaced availible for your store when I was there, and had there been, 30 minutes certainly would not have been enough time as I was there for almost a hour. Based on you poor service and chargin me $36 for something that FedEx would have done for $10, I can only assume you would have towed my vehicle and told me that there was disclaimer on the roof of the building that can only be seen with a black light during the solar eclipse on the Ides of March.","resp":{"time":1550522016761,"text":"David, we apologize that you had an unpleasant experience at our store.\n\nFirst, there is a cost associated with usage of the rental computer.

After we ordered our food we went to get drinks and unfortunately they were out of all juice in the coke machine\u201d due to something being wrong with it and getting fixed\u201d. So my husband asked for tea instead bc the tea was out. Lanesha C an employee behind the counter screamed\u201d I\u2019m not making no tea we close in a hour and I\u2019m not making no tea\u201d .while we waited for the order to be done, she is screaming and yelling still stating she was not making the tea? We went to chipotle which was next-door to get juice instead. On my way back in I was greeted by another employee and ask him what was wrong with her and why was she being so rude. He stated that she\u2019s usually nice, & that her boyfriend works here as well. As soon as we walked in her and her boyfriend who works there just fought about something, so she was angry about that.????? Literally on our way out her boyfriend whom works in the back as a cook comes up to the front, words were exchanged between him and my husband and it was literally almost a fight! Thank god two police officers were next door at chipotle and came over because at that point everyone from their kitchen was in the front trying to escalate a brawl! In front of my 9 year old! Like I felt as tho we were in the middle of the hood or in the projects! All this because we wanted tea to drink with our meal!

You order at the counter, take a number, find a seat, and they bring your food out to you.\n\nWe got the Pancake Tacos, the Modern Southern Bowl, and the Stuffed French Toast. Everything was amazing, but the Stuffed French Toast was probably our favorite. The over easy egg and fresh berries easily made it the best French toast I've ever had.\n\nI loved the pancake tacos. The flavor was great in the pancakes and scrambled eggs and the thick cut bacon put it over the top. I'm not even a big pancake person, but these were great.\n\nThe Modern Summer bowl eat light and refreshing. It definitely felt like a good healthy option compared to the other things we got. We added some of the homemade hot sauce which really complemented the flavors.\n\nWe got our food quickly and the everyone was so friendly and helpful. This is one of my favorite (possibly my favorite) brunch in Charlotte. Highly recommend!","resp":{"time":1550545573194,"text":"Thank you so much Jacqueline!

{"user_id":1.045965104e+20,"name":"JJ Souther","rating":5,"text":"Went for Queens Feast. Our server, Bret, was spot on with his service. Impeccable timing and never felt rushed to finish. Great job by management to maintain the ambience.  Overall, the food was excellent and very well prepared. We ordered the crab cake, fritto misto, penne seafood and tagliata steak.  The crab cake was crispy but not greasy.  The fritto misto, also fried, was tasty and loved the fried zucchini mixed it as well.  The penne seafood was flavorful, the penne was al dente. Would definitely order any of these again.  The steak was prepared properly but the entire plate was probably the less flavorful of all the items we ordered. I would not order the steak again.  I'm lactose intolerant, so for my dessert, I received the fresh fruit dish which is usually my only dessert choice. Really?! I have gotten to the point I usually turn down fresh fruit. But I was served the fruit anyway and these were the best strawberries I've had in years! Not sure where these were purchased, but they were picked ripe! These were not picked green then left to ripen during transit like so much of our fruits and vegetables today. The bread and white beans served as we waited for our meal was good, however, I have a pet peeve about burned bread.  And ours was on one edge. The bread was good, crusty outside, soft inside but I never understand why restaurants serve burnt bread! We ordered a bottle of wine with dinner. The wine prices are on average $40\/bottle. If you bring your own bottle, corkage is $20.\nThey were very helpful with my lactose intolerance and even made recommendations on what I could order (almost everything). NOTE: The tables on the porch were extremely close, you had to turn sideways to get to your table.  No elevator so if you can't climb stairs,  you can't eat here. I like the quiet background music, we were able to have a conversation but were so close to the other diners that we never had much of one. Maybe one row of tables rather than cramming two on the porch?","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569fe996fa9bd7:0x1c6337037bf05541"}

Unless you've had a couple drinks you'll probably be annoyed by the noise level ( bar area is raised and noise travels out into surrounding dining area). The cost for the food is kind of expensive but the presentation is nice ( unfortunately did not get any pictures). I should not have ordered the ribeye steak... I've never had a steak that tough before, ever! It was cooked medium rare and must have just been a very low quality ribeye.

Dim light but not dark next to bright whites and a glowing decor. My wife and I absolutely loved it.\n\nThe service left some to be desired. The hostess let us know that pizza bar and bar seats are first come first served but didn\u2019t check for us if there were pizza bar seats. We may not have gotten seated unless a woman (likely the owner) hadn\u2019t seated us. Food service was courteous but very slow. Our waitress was in the weeds the whole visit.\n\nThe Pizzas were delicious; very well made, hot, with a flavorful crust. There\u2019s not anything but good things to say about the pizza.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019m sure at some point the novelty will die down and service will improve. It\u2019s hard to justify coming here for pizza when Inizio can get you there without sit down service and Stagioni is up the road with PHENOMENAL pizza for just $2-3 more. Lots of Italian competition in the Charlotte area.","resp":{"time":1580767321848,"text":"Jacob - Thank you for your honest review!

The brussel sprouts however were amazing, make sure to order those. We also had the wild mushrooms & caramelized white pizza. I thought the pizza itself was average but the crust was pretty good.

I sold a 27\" Apple iMac on eBay and took it to this store for packaging and shipping last November.  I paid them to do it since I figured they were the experts and that the computer would arrive safe to it's destination.  It didn't.  What did happen is that the packaging was stamped \"fragile\" and the computer was heavily damaged upon arrival.  Their packaging was woeful and the buyer demanded a refund.  The UPS store issued a refund for the cost of the packaging and shipping - nothing more.\n\nThe buyer of the computer was then instructed by eBay to return the computer to me and they refunded him for the entire purchase.  So for 11 months, I have been waiting for my computer to return to no avail.  It turns out that somehow, the computer was sent back to the UPS store - who rejected the package so it went back the Buyer then...well no one knows where it went because it never made it to \"Lost and Found\".\n\nI have asked repeatedly for a refund and the latest is that no further refund is coming.  Instead, they attempted to mislead me by saying that UPS collects all damage claim items (a quick call to UPS verified that wasn't at all true).  In the end, I'm the big loser here. The Buyer received his money back courtesy of eBay and this UPS Store has no interest in making things right.  Don't be a big loser - don't ship here.  I certainly will not ever again.","resp":{"time":1413036240022,"text":"Mr. Osman,\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience that occurred with your shipment. The package containing the Mac you sold on eBay was declared \/ insured at the time of shipment for the standard $100. You did not wish to add additional declared value due to the fact that the overall cost of shipping would increase. We did pack your package as a fragile shipment per UPS\u2019 packaging guidelines. When the package was accidentally split during commute, the cushioning materials used escaped out of the box. What remained within the box at the time of delivery was only a small fraction of what was originally used.\n\nUPS Corporate Claims is responsible for honoring claims made, which you were reimbursed for the full amount declared \/ insured of $100 as well as the packaging and shipment costs. The reimbursement applied only to the declared \/ insured value ($100) and not to the item's actual value (estimated at $1000). The reimbursement applies to either loss or damages, but not both. Since the package was already reimbursed for its full declared value due to damages, it was not eligible for another reimbursement due to loss.\n\nThe package was never returned to our The UPS Store. It was mistakenly shipped back to the recipient by UPS Corporate. The recipient refused the package, where it was then taken to lost and found as no claimant came forward. After 3 months in the lost and found, packages are disposed by UPS Corporate. The shipment occurred in December 2013 and you contacted us inquiring about the package in July 2014, well after the 3 months period. UPS Corporate has no paperwork regarding the package since it had passed the 3 months period.\n\nAgain, we understand this has caused an inconvenience for you but we have done everything within our power to provide a solution for you."},"gmap_id":"0x88542153173c6e9f:0xe6822e4cb14b517d"}

It's a tough location for a restaurant and there's not a big crowd of us around for lunch. That said, the prices are out of this world expensive for the quality of the food, especially at lunch. And the kitchen has been slow each of the five times I've visited, despite there being very few guests.\n\nThe management\/ownership also seems to operate with little care for their guests or the surrounding businesses. Even on slow days, there are 3-5 managers\/owners there that regularly take up most\/all of the temporary visitor spaces located near the restaurant, inhibiting both their guests from being able to easily park and eat, as well as guests of surrounding businesses from being able to easily park and attend meetings, etc. When the guest spots are full, they often park in the fire lane\/drive, blocking in cars, etc. To top it off, at least one of the management misuses a handicap placard to park a Hummer in the handicapped space directly in front of the restaurant. I was nearly run over by her today as she parked and climbed out of the car staring at her phone.\n\nI'm not usually one to write bad reviews, but there's a reason the place is empty for lunch on days when La Rev across the parking lot is busy.

We ordered the muscles and Wing appetizers the wings came out fully uncut and cold it looked pretty on the plate but was not the traditional wings most are use to plus we had to ask for the blue cheese and napkins that we had ordered with them to begin with, who serves wings without napkins? they were out of mussels so I decided on a Cobb salad the Cobb salad came out with just lettuce, tomato, chicken, bacon, three slices of avocado and a boiled egg cut in half there was No roquefort cheese chunks No vinaigrette which I had asked for on the side when the food came out, instead of a vinaigrette they brought me white vinegar & oil in separate souffle cups. The other couple's food looked fantastic one had the shrimp and grits and one had the rib plate which smelled really good but the meat had no flavor she was not impressed .

{"user_id":1.107271636e+20,"name":"Daniel Boyce","rating":5,"text":"Amazing Greek coffee options, phenomenal staff, and food looks amazing. I went to this place based on a referral I received from the owner of Ilios Crafted Greek and I'm so glad I did! If you want an amazing Greek coffee (rather difficult to accomplish in my book), this place is a must. I had the Freddo Cappuccino which is a double iced espresso with frothed milk and it was absolutely amazing. The quality of coffee, richness of flavor and authentic Greek coffee taste makes it one of my new favorites. I plan to try the frappe next and then migrate to a few of the hot coffee options.\n\nI went back for a second time to check out their food and was very pleasantly surprised. The turkey avocado panini is everything I would have expected with the perfect blend of seasoning and ingredients so every item of the sandwich could be tasted without one thing overwhelming the others. My colleague ordered the Greek Toast and said it too was perfect and exactly what he was hoping for.\n\nWe also ordered the sundae crepe which of I were on vacation, I would literally eat every day of the vacation. The cookie interior was perfect without being too much frosting or cookie. The crepe was perfectly fine and the gelato on top literally made it the perfect dessert for all ages. I will absolutely be back for more!\n\nIf you are looking for a place with amazing Greek coffee and delicious desserts while also serving great quality and healthy food (to justify The desserts and coffee\ud83d\ude09), I would highly recommend checking this place out! The desserts are definitely what is drawing most people along with the amazing Greek coffee, but with food that's delicious as well, it's worth adding to the list of spots to check out.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569f93e5f3a399:0x93c8790453f4aff6"}

I have never been so disgusted by the state of a bathroom.  Two women came in and walked out.  During these times especially cleanliness is key.  The whole place was disgusting I got our drinks and dumped them outside after telling the girls about the bathroom, who didn\u2019t care at all.

I wish the hot oil was spicier or more of a paste\/sauce than oil. I also wish the corn was warm.\n\nFor dessert, we got the Akatskream. Basically an ice cream sandwich with a donut as the \u201cbun.\u201d 5\/5 the ice cream flavors rotate and tonight we had the Black Sesame. Amazing. Will get this dish every time.\n\nOverall, delicious. I can\u2019t wait to come back for the Ichiraku (pork) ramen. Granted, we split a ramen, but with an app, meal and dessert it was only like $30 pre-tip. I also love paying electronically and not having to deal with printed receipts and going back and forth.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88541fe537292be7:0x87140305d8e79e8d"}

The cuts of meat are delicious. We get the chicken often and love picking up some salmon and scallops from them. The scallops are unreal. They have great side and vegetable options, and the wine selection is excellent. We members of the wine club and are always really happy with the wine they pick out. Normally they do an event each month as well for members, but due to covid have instead given out a treat with the wine. Last month it was three delicious sausages. Also, they carry deserts (try the brownies, you won't regret it).\n\nAlso, to give you an idea of the customer service, this past weekend was our anniversary. We each ordered a filet with sides, a bottle of wine, truffle fries, and some scallops. Everything was cooked perfectly and we were super excited. When we arrived home we noticed the scallops were missing. We gave them a call, and they actually drove us the scallops to our home (TALK ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE). We love this place, and are now planning our weekly meals around it!","resp":{"time":1591481135336,"text":"Thank you Dustin! We loved making your anniversary dinner!

Even the process of getting a check for these drinks took longer than we wanted to and ended up leaving cash in the table and leaving.\nFrom start to finish the service was horrible.

{"user_id":1.042775534e+20,"name":"larry ramsey","rating":2,"text":"Almost one year ago to the day, my friends and I met for our annual holiday dinner.  I had chosen Comida, which was then located in the old Penguin location off of Central Ave. as we were looking for an upscale Mexican meal.  The experience and the meal were the stuff of legend.  The menu was focused on Spanish and Mexican dishes that were done to perfection.  We learned that they would be closing at the end of that month and moving to their current location on Selwyn.  When it came time to get a reservation for this year's meal, Comida was a unanimous choice.\n\nUpon arriving, the look\/feel of the restaurant was appealing, very similar to the previous space, but that is where the similarities ended.  We mentioned why were there, and our previous visit and were told that the menu was \"completely different\".  Our first clue.  Looking at this new menu, I was disappointed how many of the items were indeed gone from before.\n\nTo jump to the meal, we had the fresh pork skins which were seasoned with a spicy dusting which was very good.  A solid 4 out of 5.  We also had the Chicharron de Queso, which on our previous visit was made with a different cheese and was much lighter and more delicate.  This one had to be manhandled to break apart. The dip was good.  A 3 out of five.   I had the sauted shishito peppers in cream sauce, a solid 4 out of 5.  Two of our party had the street corn, which they both liked a 4 out of 5 again.  Two of us had the pork shank, which I expected to be pull apart tender, but required serious knife and fork skills to take a part.  Very tough and dry, a 2 out of 5. A fourth had the duck, which he said was good - 4 out of 5.\n\nService was spotty, despite the fact there were few other patrons there that night.  We did not feel \"attended to\".  This was once again in comparison to our previous visit, where we had been treated to a conversation with the chef and even exchanged some contact information and recipes.  I would give the ambiance and service a 2 out of five.\n\nSo a note to self for us that we will be searching for a new place in the coming year.  And, I'll be toning down my recommendation to those who ask (friends, family, etc.).  I see many effusive and positive reviews posted, and I do not doubt that those folks had great meals and experiences.  I can only conclude that they never tried the other location.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8856a00057420dc7:0x392f45b345f69ec9"}

She helped us with wine choices, talked about her favorite menu items and made suggestions.  Her counterpart, Dustin, was also fabulous.\n\nFave foods from our experience:\nMaple glazed brussels sprouts - excellent even without the bacon (we were with someone who doesn't eat meat)\nThe Summit burger - I had without the brioche bun and it was phenomenal.  I even took one home for hubby.\nThe Mixed Greens salad - I had this in place of the fries.  Blueberries, walnuts, fresh peach slices and some diced sweet potato - fabulous!\n\nAt the time we finished our meal and were just chatting with one another (about 90 minutes later), there were still plenty of open tables inside the restaurant, with at least 4 tables visible that had never been seated during our meal.  They did fill up the bar area, including the host asking me to move my bag which I'd placed next to me in order to pay the bill.\n\nMy 2 star ding for this review is solely due to the host at the door and his demeanor when we arrived and when we left.  His parting words \"Thanks for showing up and eating and drinking\"  What?!?!  He needs some training on how to schedule tables for reservations so they can also take walk-ins as well how to talk to human beings.\n\nAnyways, thanks to Angela anf Dustin for excellent service.  A return visit will be completely due to you and the others who helped take care of us.\n\nLet's be clear - I am not saying to avoid this restaurant but diner beware - if you don't have a reservation, you're on  your own for a seat at the bar or outside.   Even if you do have a reservation, they may seat you at a long table where they eventually also seat other people who aren't with your party (we witnessed that happening too while we were there).","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569f97063b6b47:0xf79f169108cfad97"}

I currently work here, and this is what they do for trainees.\nYou watch. You get to watch how everything is done instead of being thrown in without a clue and completely slowing down everything. That's why when new people are trained, they're seen as \"standing on the side\" or \"taking a lunch break.\" We learn by watching and seeing where everything is and how it's done, first day, then we start doing things on our own. It encourages competency and builds confidence because you don't have to be deathly afraid of screwing things up as soon as you walk in. It's a radically different approach, but one that's so much more efficient.\nThey really do care about the health of their customers, and all the ingredients are fresh or made in the house (with the exception of the bottled drinks sold on the side, such as coconut water and expresso cold brewed coffee.) I'm impressed - the other health food place I have worked at had prepackaged and frozen materials, but this place has raw ingredients, and organized everything so as little cross contamination as possible can occur (for example, the almond milk is set aside from all the other juices\/milks used in case someone has almond allergies.)\nAnd it's pristine. Working in the food industry, there's a high chance of finding places that have the mentality to just clean up the workspace, and not necessarily everywhere else. Here, EVERYTHING will get cleaned. Daily. It's wonderful to work for a place where the proper guidelines are followed and they care about the quality of the food, as well as the proper training of their workers.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8856a025eb032329:0xd11e34997fcd37cd"}

I will definitely be returning. I hope they out grow their present location, which is a small storefront shop.\n\nWe wanted a quick bite before a game, and decided on Vietnamese. We were going to stop at a Pho place, then we saw this next door. So glad we did! We ordered taro boba teas, a traditional banh mi pork sandwich, lemongrass chicken sandwich, and a traditional pork and egg steamed bun. Everything was delicious! My only remark is to ask for the bang mi buns to be less toasted (my preference).\n\nThe owner is super sweet and staff seem to enjoy their jobs, which makes for a great experience. They also offer pastries like: Napoleans, Tres Leches, Macaroons, cake slices, and cookies. Their milk tea, smoothie, and drink selection is vast, which I look to explore later.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88541fa6df69e959:0x1c2a67752c623516"}

This is the worst experience I have ever had at a Cheddars and I've dined at Cheddars in 6 different states because it used to be my favorite. This experience was a TOTAL mess from the get go. We walked in the front door and there were two other guests ahead of us at the host station. No employees present at all. After probably 5 min or so the host finally shows up. The guests in front of us told her they had been looking for her. The response they got was repulsive, the girl just giggled at them like it was a joke. After we got seated we had waited ten minutes and we had not even seen a server in our section. So I called the restaurant by phone and told whoever answered that we had not been greeted or had a drink order taken. It must have been the same hostess that seated the first guests mentioned before because she laughed me when I told her that! Then someone brings us croissants which were very delicious. BUT, bread without a drink is no fun and we still had not been greeted by our server or had drink orders taken. It took 15 minutes before we even found out who our server was. She had to apologize for the kitchen multiple times. The hot honey sauce was not correct and she had to ask my partner how he liked his broccoli because it had been cooked wrong all day. Then, when my food came (chicken tend platter w\/fries and ched broc cass) my casserole wasn't there! I do not believe for a second any of this was our servers fault. I feel like there is poor and weak leadership of this location. Oh, and the hostess double sat our server with a big top right after we got sat. The restaurant was empty not busy. Just everything that could be wrong at this particular Cheddars was wrong. This should embarrass whoever owns and operates this location.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88541c2fc456489b:0x263dc64a613e1e0f"}

So we ended up in the area and decided to check them out.\nThe place was clean and we were greeted by a very friendly and smiling staff.  We were seated and we started looking at the menu.  I am a fish person so I decided to give it a go.  It can with broccoli and rice. I was able to exchange the cook carrots for a bowl of macaroni and cheese.  The food arrived within 10 minutes which really surprised me and it was. Bit into the fish and found it to be very tasty with a good amount of seasoning. I was pleasantly surprised.\nThe waitress checked on us enough without being overbearing. And always with a small on her face. The thing that makes me give it five stars is I ended up leaving my credit card. And had driven more than an hour and a half away before I realized my mistake. I was able to call the the establishment and spoke to a manager and was pleased to find that the waitress had turned the card over to her immediately. Everything was taken care of and I could not be any happier. The honesty and the great service definitely puts this place at five stars in my book. The food was an added plus with the great taste.\nUnfortunately we do not have a Cheddars in the Raleigh Durham area so I will not be able to experience this restaurant on a regular basis. But if you're in the Concord area or any place that has this establishment give it a try. It's basic food with a very good taste.","resp":{"time":1573753119518,"text":"How awesome to hear, Shane!

(dumbfounded, first I've ever heard of this in the keep my sweet tea full in the South sweetheart), to getting served food by someone other than waitress, and our 1x refill after food was brought out by someone other than our server who never checked on us. This pic shows where my food did not arrive with rest of table's service. Someone other than waitress brought our food out and my food was just chicken tenders w buffalo sauce. We were in a booth and the waitress eventually brought my food separate handed my plate across the table and I burned my hand receiving my meal from where my portion of the plate had been under the heat lamp. When I nearly dropped my plate, the waitress never said sorry but that her end of the plate was not hot.\nNo emotion. No sense of urgency. No sense of care for our dining experience. It was literally take our order, bring it out and then the check and each step of the meal took 15-20 min intervals. Order, drinks w bread, salads no refills, then 4 out of 5 meals still no refills, my food, then refills, then check, then wait on her return for signing for our check... we were sat in rear of restaurant and there was a larger birthday party being served by a different waiter.\nI am not one to complain and I was with family so I didnt want to show out. It was uncomfortable because we all felt like something should be said but we wanted to give the server the benefit of the doubt that it may have been the waitress' inexperience or poor training. But we couldnt even talk to the manager because she was already talking to another table in our section being served by the same waitress, who were sat after us. We were using gift cards and could have gone to Olive Garden or Long Horn like 5 other places instead. Lesson learned. We only had a party of 5. We ordered 2 waters and 2 sweet teas and an Arnold Palmer.\nEither train staff better or at least find folks who treat people the way they would want to be treated.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88541c2fc456489b:0x263dc64a613e1e0f"}

{"user_id":1.130007201e+20,"name":"Indi Blaze","rating":1,"text":"Sooo we went here yesterday after my son's graduation and had a party of about 35 people. They said they couldn't accommodate seating for that large of a number yet they had just opened their doors and we were the only people there. They said they longer seat large parties as of policy changes last week. The most they could do was seat 4 to a table spread throughout the restaurant. The manager on duty had the most unfriendly face and attitude. Well needless to say they missed out on nearly $1k. We proudly took our business across the street to TGI Friday's where they warmly welcomed us all and actually sat us ALL together! The staff there was amazing!! From the greeter to the server to the bartender, everyone was pleasant and the service was great. Cheddars could learn a thing or five from their neighbors. I don't think they will be getting my business anymore. I would've given it 0 stars but 1 was the minimum.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88541c2fc456489b:0x263dc64a613e1e0f"}

Back in the day, I could get a cheeseburger and fries for $4.99 - but I understand inflation.\nWhat keeps me coming back in the door even after all the bad press is the Painkiller. I ordered that along with steak and chicken tenders with a loaded baked potato and broccoli for the sides. The Painkiller was tasty, but significantly weaker as far as alcohol than it used to be. I feel like it used to taste a lot better in the past. With a 2 drink limit, I expect to feel a buzz after one. I felt nothing. The food was ok. I did not like the tenders, the steak was nicely seasoned but overcooked - I asked for medium and it was almost well done. My daughter ordered the kids penne with marinara sauce and received a bowl of dry noodles with a dollop of sauce in the middle.\nWe waited quite a while to place our order. It took at least 45 minutes if not longer to receive the food. Our waitress did come and apologize to us for the wait after we had been waiting for about 30 minutes. She said the kitchen was backed up.\nI could clearly tell when I recieved my food that it was sitting under a hot lamp for a good while because the cheese was very melted on my potato - like the way it looks on top of baked mac n cheese. This was different from the regular melt that happens when you put cheese on top of a hot potato.  The waitstaff forgot my broccoli, brought an empty container of A1 and took at least 10 minutes to bring a full one. Get this, Cheddar's charges tonout bacon on a LOADED BAKED POTATO. Bacon is part of the very definition of \"loaded\". Needless to say tho my experience wasn't extremely horrible, I will not come back to Cheddar's again. I feel like the entire bill was a waste of money. Thankfully, the manager discounted our bill for all of our troubles.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88541c2fc456489b:0x263dc64a613e1e0f"}

Seemed like a canned good just microwaved.\n- my wife ordered ceaser salad with chicken. Obviously the chicken was raw and some wilted salad and tomatoes. We told the waiter that the chicken was uncooked and removed all of it from the plate. All she has to say was im sorry.\nTo top it over when we got the check, and this is new one for me, there were options for 18%, 20% and 22% gratuity options.

Thirty minutes later we are finally seated and noticed there are 5 empty booths in our section, and a completely empty section on the other side of us. Oh well, let's eat.... 10 minutes later we stop a server who was waiting on the guests 2 tables in front of us and ask where our server was, as we still hadn't been greeted or offered drinks. She stumbles around in the back looking for whoever. A few minutes later, we ask the hostess to get the manager. The server we stopped comes back to take our drink orders, I told her we were ready to order food and drinks but she said she couldn't take our food order!?!?! I'd had it at that point. I told her don't worry about it, bring me the manager and a Diet Coke to go. I waited 5 more minutes, no manager (Emily was on duty) ever showed up. So we left, not without sharing our experience with some waiting guests on the way out, including a party of 5 that was waiting alongside us when we were in the lobby. In the car on the way to Boston Market, we got the manager on the phone who apologized and promised to send a gift certificate via email. It's been 7 days and we've yet to see that promise... not that we were ever likely to use it anyway.\nI work in the area and used to frequent Cheddars for lunch.

After I had been there ten minutes, he began to say how he was feeling impatient and I agreed that we should have probably been acknowledged. We stood there for another five minutes and the waitress finally chatted with the man near me but she had to go back and check on the (previously called in) order the first man was waiting on. After she came back, she finally asked if she could help me and I told her that I only wanted to buy a gift card. She then told me that she would be right with me.

We were sat at 6pm, the waitress was not really attentive and didn't take our drink order until about 20 mins of waiting so we decided to order our food and drinks together to avoid another long wait. We received our drinks a few minutes later. An hour after being sat we finally got our food. Wasn't too pleased with how long it took to receive our food considering the fact that they weren't that packed and had a whole section packed. The table behind us also had some issues with the same waitress not being attentive and asked for a manager. I learned from the manager that the waitress was new and so I guess that explains the long wait for everything and her not being attentive to her tables. It also took forever to receive to go boxes and the check.

It started out good. We were a group of 8 ( celebrating my nephew senior night at Vance football game) and was happy the wait wasn't long(3-5 min tops) .\nThey sat us near the in\/out pick up entrance for the servers to go in and out to get the food.  All night there was a loud call every time a server went in or out. ( VERY ANNOYING)\nSo we proceed to order our drinks and food. The others (7) with me order first. I couldn't decide so I told him to put their orders in and please come back to me; which he did. When I did order about 10 min later ( French onion soup) my order comes back first and COLD.  The server takes it back. Then everyone else's food start to come out 1 or 2 every 15- 20min APART! (Basically we didn't eat together) My soup comes back COLD AGAIN! Not everyone had utensils to eat with either. ( It was a mess)  Now when the server brings my soup back the 3RD TIME,  it is hot, but upon eating it I find 2 FRENCH FRIES COOKED IN THE BOTTOM OF MY FRENCH ONION SOUP! TOTAL DISGUST!!!!\nNEVER WILL WE GO THERE AGAIN. SERVICE AND MANAGEMENT IS TERRIBLE!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88541c2fc456489b:0x263dc64a613e1e0f"}

Lately, the staff has an attitude problem.  Came in last night for a salad- there were five other people in the restaurant- it was 8:40.\n\nThe woman behind the counter did not acknowledge us standing there for at least five minutes, probably longer while she did her side work.  Then told us she was out of things that we knew she had, because they were on the other line right next to her.  Then she yells to her co worker to \"come get these salads!\" because she can't do both things.  I have worked in restaurants for years, and she does not need to be in the front of an open concept kitchen- move her to the back of the house.  Then when she sends our salads to the back for the protein, she whispers something in the grill cooks ear- probably told him to spit in our food.\n\nI am calling the management today- absolutely unbelievable.  I am paying ten dollars for a take-out salad, and I should not be made to feel like I have done something wrong for walking in the door.\n\nThere are no hours posted anywhere- on the door, on the website, nowhere.  If they close at 9:00, then I will not walk in 20 minutes before close, but 8:40 on a Thursday night is not unreasonable- especially in this neighborhood- and if the kitchen is closing, then say so.  I will happily go elsewhere, as I have worked in places where people walk in with 2 minutes left for the night and made us reopen the line, but pans hadn't been changed out, nor the station wiped down yet.  Absolutely unbelievable.\n\nUpdate:  I tried calling the restaurant twice with no answer, and then tried their email address from their website, and the e-mail was returned because the mailbox is full.Unfortunate, because I feel that the manager\/ owner needs to know.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569ff9710c05e9:0x473a632510586d22"}

{"user_id":1.101167557e+20,"name":"alberto cabrera","rating":1,"text":"I have gone to Anntony's for the longest time. Since 1994. In 2000, I moved to another state and unfortunately the owner sold the restaurant as a franchise and moved to Sugarcreek. Since then, I would come back to Charlotte once a year to see family and visited the 7th street location. Unfortunately, I had noticed the quality of the food declining over the years. First it was they stop basting and marinating the chicken in Anntony's Sauce. Which is the whole point about Anntony's. Then they stop seasoning the chicken. But they still roasted the chicken and used the sauce, so I was still good.\n\nIt's 2016, and this place is now a disappointment. The only thing that is Anntony's is the sauce. The quality of the chicken has gone down. I have never been so disappointed when I saw my food. Anntony's was famous for its Anntony's All-Purpose Sauce and Chicken. The original staff would start slow roasting his chicken with a bucket of sauce and basing it at every turn. Creating chicken wings of sticky and saucy goodness.\n\nThis time, I ordered for takeout blindly expecting the same chicken I have eaten for years. Nope, this time, it seems there's either a new owner or manager. They closed off the bar area and now instead of slow-roasting the chicken, they deep fried it and let it sit in a hot bin till someone places an order. What a disappoint. The chicken doesn't even have a good color. It looks over fried and old. The chicken meat is dry and bland. No better than fried buffalo wings from an old bar.\n\nPlease do not go here and head to the Sugarcreek location instead. At least they still make the chicken by Anntony's standards. I haven't been there yet on this current trip to Charlotte. But I may just go tomorrow so that I can have a good experience with Anntony's wings before I leave.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569ff9698cf22d:0x78c0f78348b89cee"}

However, it does NOT give you the right to say what you want when you want without consequences. If you are at work, you are representing your employer.

The food is amazing and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We ordered the curry and empanadas. For the quality the taste the food gets a 5\/5. The only reason I dropped a star is the horrible smell on the back patio.\nThey have such a large and great back area but it needs a little bit of TLC. It\u2019s got one of the largest back patios of NoDa but the design of the area is severely lacking. With a little bit of extra work this place would be a new hot spot of NoDa. I know the smell is mainly due to the dumpster, which isn\u2019t really their fault, but I believe in them to find a creative and effective solution :).

Double order of livers and an order of gizzards. Got them to go. Smelled so good in the car. Got home and tried one out before settling in for a good lunch. The livers were not even cleaned and were not even seasoned. Just dropped in flour and fried. Gizzards were so rubbery and bland tasting also. The few that I had made me sick for 2 days. Had to throw $25 worth of food away. Couldn't salvage them at all. Will never be back again.  Such a waste of time and money.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88541e160772f1ed:0xde067b4b52c7ae48"}

Get to the restaurant and she says I have to wait for a DoorDash driver to give me the food I paid for. Even after I showed her the confirmation email its my order!! She is in the restaurant yelling at me about how she can't give me my food because of her contract with DoorDash. Then why is DoorDash letting me order it pick it up?? Then she is yelling at her employees in front of customers, yelling at other customers, and being completely unprofessional. What is sad is this lady is old enough to be someone's grandmother, so you would think the time on this earth spent she would have learned something about being professional or how to conduct herself as a manager. Food is decent. But my last time spending money at this place. I usually only post good reviews and keep the bad to myself.

After waiting additional time I get up to the window and was told my order contained a lot of beef items and i needed to go around to park.

He left and I stood outside with know resolution. I had to walk around to the drive thru where the employees found humor and addressed me with a derogatory racial name.  I then called the police. Four police vehicles arrived and there still was know resolution. I am out of $18 and time. If these individuals are representative of Taco Bell what does that say about Taco Bell.

I could barely squeeze in between two people already sitting and couldn't even hear my husband sitting directly across from me because it was so loud. I went up to the counter to try and order and by coincidence was helped by Meredith, the owner. I had to ask her three times whether it was order at the counter or table service before getting a clear answer and I could barely read the menu while standing right in front of it because it is written in white on an antiqued mirror. Meredith told us that you can only order by picking the number of cheeses you want on the board and adding meats but nowhere were any selections visible so I guess they just pick whatever they want to give you and no customization is available. For a shop that only serves cheese and wine this puzzled me. Not to mention the fact that they only serve one red and one white by the glass. If you don't go with one of those options you have to squeeze behind everyone at the communal table to try and pick out a bottle. I could not see any organizational system of grouping the wines, labeling or prices whatsoever. Clearly this place is very popular and people must be loving something about it but I have no idea what that is. We left without ordering because the whole system frankly didn't work for me at all.","resp":{"time":1537715210443,"text":"You are right, we were busy.  I am still learning.

Seaweed salad was yummy and I love the crispy onions.  My office is near by and I love being able to walk to grab some lunch - which means I also hope that this restaurant has the staying power... May not be a bad idea to have a more aggressive rewards program or a lunch special.  Unfortunately not everyone will be up for a 13.00 poke plate --- just something to think about.

This place was basically a hood club in downtown Charlotte. This is nothing against the owner because these trying times make that money. But a $30 entry fee per person is extremely steep. However, the place was packed so obviously the demand was there.\n\nThe owner stopped us as we walked away and offered for us a discounted price which was appreciated. The owners son allowed us to view the lounge prior to paying, which we appreciated.\n\nMy only complaint is the misleading name of the place. It should be called Babylon Night Club offering hookah. Even nightclub is a stretch because it is so packed that nobody is dancing.\n\nLastly these are COVID times and the place was beyond over packed for Occupancy Space according to the city, COVID restrictions, and no face masks.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8856a17d6104addd:0x820d5fd6c0bc91b5"}

There is rarely receipt paper in the pumps outside, which means you have to go in if you need it. If you're lucky, there won't be a 10-person line at the time (but there usually is, meanwhile there will be an employee outside smoking a cigarette).

I got the Nachos Surpreme and a steak burrito. The nachos (looks amazing in the pic, don't they???) were decent -- nothing to really write home about -- and I wasn't too much feeling the burrito. Tasted surprisingly bland. Also, customer service was meh -- the folks there don't seem to be the friendliest bunch! I even had to ask what my total was when he took my card for the payment, and then he gave it back without any sort of official conclusion to the transaction (no \"thank you,\" \"please sign here,\" \"here's your receipt,\" \"would you like a receipt,\" etc.). I had to ask him a few times to confirm what the amount had been, making a mental note to confirm it on my bank statement later. Not ideal. Granted, I normally don't necessarily \"need\" a receipt, but some sort of visual indication and confirmation of the price -- or at the very least, his voluntary verbal confirmation, to where I wouldn't have to ask -- would've been nice!!\n\nOverall, not the greatest experience or journey worth driving cross-town for (I'd searched for \"the best Mexican food in Charlotte\", and this was one with seemingly the highest ratings that came up, so I took a chance). Next time, I'll just stick to somewhere closer to home or go to Taco Bell.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569fc7a899a1d9:0x8b5f6f2819b83cea"}

The hand-pattied burger was tasty but not cooked to my ordered temp of med rare. The lobster and shrimp with asparagus pasta special had overcooked, slightly chewy lobster and only had a single stalk of asparagus at most.

I love trying food around Charlotte and decided to try this place after the hubby drove by and seen the sign. The Louisiana aspect of it got his attention. We ordered 8 piece fried chicken combo box that came with 2 sides in which we chose red beans and rice as well as the corn fritters. It also came with 6 rolls. Okay I hate to say it but I have to be honest, the sides were not to my liking at all. As as someone who loves the red beans and rice from Popeye's as well as the homemade red beans and rice that my husband makes, this did not compare at all. They were very bland and dry. The corn fritters had potential but they didn't hit the spot either. Oh yeah the rolls tasted stale and we didn't even bother with those. Now on to the chicken. If you don't like spicy food it won't be for you. You can actually see the spices under the skin. I will admit the chicken was very flavorful and tasty. The skin was crispy and the meat itself was moist. Next time I visit I will be sure to only order a box of chicken without sides. I almost forgot, I ordered a Thai tea as well. You're probably thinking, what does Thai tea have to do with Louisiana Fried Chicken....absolutely nothing...but they have it and it was entirely too sweet.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88541fb1b23d622f:0x71e6dc567862fab7"}

I'm not really a big fan of sweet stuff but the fritters were ok too. I went right back in and ordered 3 wings and more fritters. Considering the type of place it is I can honestly imagine them having their bad days, but gladly this wasn't one of them. I was starving that day, and i drove off happy.

This isn't just my opinion, it's a collective review of 12 people.\nThe highlight was the fried corn fritters and slaw. They were very good. If that was all our order consisted of this would be a 5 star review. We also received some of the dirty rice and mashed potatoes w\/gravy. It wasn't bad, just very ordinary.\nThe chicken? Worst on earth. What's funny is that before today I didn't know this place also sold fried fish. Our staff came up with a collective description of what this terrible mess tasted like: day old bojangles dipped in way too much zatarain's spice and then re-fried in fish grease. Yes..fish grease! Which is undeniably what they must do!\nNow you can tear a way at the overly charred outside to get to the plain ole chicken underneath. There is absolutely no seasoning in the meat, it is all in the crust. It then becomes a bit more edible, but not really worth the effort.\nI have read some reviews of people who actually like this chicken. I really find that hard to believe. It must be the staff or friends trying to pull the rating it up. It is bad.\nSo if you go there order corn fritters and slaw. You wont be disappointed.

They serve from 11-5pm!!! And the special is only 10.00!\nI selected the shepherds pie and the butter lettuce salad. The shepherds pie was a perfect size for me. Great taste. Full of mashed potatoes. Good flavor. If I had anything negative to say it would be that it wish it had more veggies and a little less mashed potatoes but I really can't complain. It was delicious. (I'm also sure that I'm the minority in that request ha!)\nThe butter salad was a great compliment (recommended to me by the manager and she was right!). Compared to the pie, it was super light. The homemade lemon vinaigrette was not heavy at all and gave just a touch of taste with the beets and carrots to make this salad awesome.\nI also figured I'd have a glass of wine. Why not?! I was allowed to taste it (nice sized taste even) and then when I liked it, I was given a very nice pour. They'll take care of you here for sure!\nThis space is very nice. Pretty bar. Great tables and lots of space for a party, so you can bring your friends and have plenty of space. They take reservations as well so call ahead!\nFour TV's had ESPN on and two had Irish type photos. I'm sure the other two are switched when it is busy. I visited at 4:30 on a Wednesday. Not a lot of people around at that time.\nI asked about the beer. They have rotating taps of awesome local beers while keeping a few Irish staples (like Guiness) on hand...since they are an Irish bar. And my favorite....Fever Tree tonic!! I don't see that often in bars so if you like a good gin and tonic I'm sure this is the place to get it!\nI'll definitely be back.

They offer curbside pickup. This was the worst part of our experience though. We got there at the time our food was supposed to be ready. We call and no one answers the phone (many times). Eventually, I decide to go inside because it seems like the only way to get my food. The food wasn't ready and she did bring it out once it was (a good 20 minutes after it was supposed to be ready).\n\nWe got the Mojo Hash, the Bird in the Hand, the Sweet Potato Waffle, a couple of wings, and Tennessee Fries.\n\nEverything was outstanding. I made a sandwich with the sweet potato waffle and wings which was probably my favorite thing. Probably the best chicken and waffle combo I've had.\n\nThey used a chicken thigh for the Bird in the Hand which I loved because it was huge and juicy. It was a great chicken sandwich.\n\nI loved the flavor of the hash. The only downside was that we ordered an over easy egg and we got it over hard. We ate our food within 5 minutes of getting it, so either they overcooked it or it was sitting around for a while before they gave it to us.\n\nWhatever you do, you have to get the Tennessee Fries. The seasoning is to die for. They also put it on their wings.\n\nThere are a lot of mixed reviews on here which I don't understand.

Entree sizes were big enough to get a second meal from leftovers. The egg foo young is just what I wanted in old school Chinese fare - hot, oily, eggy fritters with a generous amount of gravy. The gravy here is yellow and tastes like Chinese five spice with a hint of curry. We also have ordered the sa cha beef, kon bo chicken, and chicken with hot garlic sauce. All were delicious and they did not skimp on sauce in each stir-fry. Pork egg rolls were also great. The fried rice that comes with the entrees could be a bit more fried and brown, but did have veggies and egg bits in it and was not dry. I am guessing a full side of fried rice that had a meat choice would be cooked to order.\n\nOverall, I am impressed and this is my new go-to place for Chinese!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x885421fe50e10e59:0xb093cdf1709742b1"}

There was 5 of us and we all were super excited to try the stuff here because we've been planning our trip to Charlotte for months and came across the delicious looking menu. The stuff on their site's menu does not match the actual menu once there. They were out of a few deserts too. I ordered an alcohol infused cupcake and 2 other people in my party ordered cupcakes not infused. One of them said it tasted like their was alcohol in theirs. Then none of our drinks had the included candy and\/or fruit garnishes that were supposed to be included. Whoever owns this joint needs to make sure that they supply the items on their menu. It's a bit crazy that we all ordered different drinks and all of them had one or more missing things with it.

{"user_id":1.074443334e+20,"name":"Jacqueline Telljohann","rating":5,"text":"We had a couple of good recommendations to try the Stanley, so we used our anniversary as a good excuse to check out out.\n\nReservations are recommended, although if you eat early like we do, you can probably get away without one.\n\nWe started with The Cortez cocktail which we both loved. It was refreshing and not too sweet.\n\nWe always go with small plates at a restaurant like this. They change the menu almost daily, so you never know what will be on it.\n\nWe tried the Surf & Turf, Foie Gras, Steam Buns (pork belly), Braised Chicken Tostada, and Short Rib Ravioli. We loved everything with one exception \u2014 the ravioli. It wasn't bad, but it definitely didn't compare to how good everything else was. It was supposed to have goat cheese in it, but we tasted no cheese at all. The chicken tostada was our favorite followed closely by the surf and turf.\n\nFor dessert we got the Swiss Roll. I think the menu was misleading on this one. I don't like chocolate, but the menu said white chocolate, cranberry, and pistachio. I assumed it didn't have chocolate because it said white chocolate, but that was not the case (it just had a white chocolate drizzle). My husband loved it though.\n\nIt's a farm to table restaurant and you can definitely tell the ingredients are fresh. I wasn't super impressed with the service. It was good enough, but our waiter felt a little cold.\n\nThere's a lot of complaints in the reviews that I think are not the fault of the restaurant. Yes, it's fairly pricey. This should be expected at a farm to table small plates restaurant. We felt like the quality of the food lived up to the price.\n\nI think The Stanley is definitely worth checking out. Just make sure to have the right expectations coming in.","resp":{"time":1597453377177,"text":"Thank you for the thorough review, Jacqueline!

If you\u2019re overpaying for food, shouldn\u2019t service be EXTRA stellar? On top of that, the food was just terrible - two of the four of us took one bite of our meal and our server didn\u2019t even ask what was wrong. Also, one of the members of our party ordered a coke, which comes in a small 8oz cocktail glass (fountain soda with ice) and they charged for every refill without even mentioning it. So the one coke he ordered cost him $12. Most importantly, The food quality was surprisingly low. The chicken salad sandwich tasted like a salt-lick, actually inedible. I have absolutely no idea how this place is going to make it. They need a major attitude adjustment, above all else.

I've been wanting to try this place since they opened based on the idea of an ever changing menu and the prestige of the chefs.  The food was gorgeous, pictured are entrees because we forgot to get the 2 small plates ordered up front.\n\nThe only thing that prevents this from getting 5 stars was the timing.  Some small plates type establishments have the timing down to a science and we had a decent wait between ordering 1st course and getting the entrees in.  Minor issue but noticable.\n\nCocktails were noticably creative and perfect sippers, I recommend their take on an old fashioned, but skip the prince of thieves.  Conceptually a drink with black garlic sounds amazing, and to be fair, with food it works, however after dinner sipping the black garlic flavor takes over.\n\nUnisex bathrooms are always a win in Charlotte so good on them.  All in all will be back, perhaps next time for just a few small plates and some cocktails to save a few shekels.  Use Google to secure a reservation as the seating is limited.","resp":{"time":1597453251846,"text":"Hi Bryan, thank you for the thorough review.

We were waiting for this couple to leave and the guy came to me and said that the couple sitting at the lounge were waiting before us. Okay, so they move to the bar area and he said to us to wait at the lounge area. This couple came in, order a drink and right after two chairs get available and guess what? They got seated before us.

Unfortunately, when my friend & I walked in we were not greeted with the same excitement. All we received was \"Do you have a reservation?\" Which, no, we did not, but also we were not eating & I had just called minutes ago to ask if the bar was available just for cocktails. Which that call was also not very friendly. To make it even worse once we sat at the empty bar (this was around 5PM on Valentine's day) the female bartender was less than kind. In my excitement I gleefully asked \"What's your most popular drink?!\" Her response in the most unpleasant & condescending way was \"it really just depends on the day hun...\" Wow. Customer service seemed devastatingly nonexistent in this establishment. My guy friend & I literally were one foot out the door & dear Vinny came to the rescue. He is the best bartender I've had in a long time! Hey Vinny!!!! I wish I could give more stars but the discomfort we felt from the beginning far outweighed this incredible bartender that tried to save his fellow coworkers poor treatment of us.

{"user_id":1.164535978e+20,"name":"Adam Peter Shinn","rating":3,"text":"Those of you looking for a review on the Stanley burger that Ted Williams ranked #1 in Charlotte Agenda look no further. My wife and I were eager to try this spot because it had dethroned my current favorite burger spot Bang Bang after many years of top spot dominance. I also agree with at least 90% of Ted\u2019s list so we had to try it. So.... did Ted get it right this time? My answer is no. That being said, I would place their burger, definitely in my top 10 and possibly in my top 5. A good if not great burger that\u2019s a tad overhyped. What went wrong though? Well, first of all, this burger is EXTREMELY hard to get ahold of. Maybe that\u2019s part of the appeal... the exclusivity and scarcity. Hell, you can only get the burger two nights out of the week (Friday and Saturday), only at the bar, and from 9-10 PM during their last hour of service. On top of that, it\u2019s coming in pricey at $18. But does all of that make it taste better? Well, after my wife and I looked like fools sitting down at a table trying to order the burger and being met with no accommodation whatsoever, we relinquished our seats and sat back in the waiting area, with no guarantee we would be seated at the bar since there were three parties ahead of us and 30 minutes before close. We decided to wait anyway to try the vaunted burger since that was our sole mission (aside from ordering cocktails that were great). Upon waiting, the manager came out and explained they offered the burger as a way to promote sitting at the bar. I mean I appreciated the explanation, and I get it, but what\u2019s the point of not serving it at the rest of the restaurant if someone doesn\u2019t know that? I\u2019d rather you accommodate, spank me on the wrist, and tell me to order it at the bar next time instead of \u201cno burger for you\u201d. I started to notice he and the bartenders spoke of this burger as if it was somewhat of a \u201cunhappy surprise\u201d as the publicity was working against them and how busy they are because of it. Anyhow, we got seated with 20 min to spare. My wife and I started chatting with a couple beside us about burgers. We talked about Bang Bang and we all got enthusiastic. One of the bartenders gloated back with \u201cyeah, but wait til you try ours guys. Whole \u2018nother level.\u201d Now the anticipation was looming. We received the burgers and they were served with a side of chips. Not a lot of food for $18 but what was on the plate looked good! The burger looked high quality, cheese running down the side, a nice soft dukes bun (like Bang Bang\u2019s), a very fresh tomato on the side that looked fresh out the garden. A side of ketchup and Grey Poupon were also served on the side. My wife and I split it. My impression was that the burger was very high quality and largely carried the whole team. Is it the best quality burger patty in Charlotte and better than Bang Bang? Possibly! But it would be marginal and not day and night. The bun was great too. But it needed ketchup, mustard, something to give it a little something extra. Overall, it was good but I wasn\u2019t blown away. That leaves me to believe it is overhyped to some degree. Maybe Ted and I just had different levels of expectations going in, but I wouldn\u2019t put it over most of the Burgers I\u2019ve tried from Bang Bang across the street. Even the Crunkleton on the other side of the building had a better burger in my opinion. So they are literally surrounded with better burger options. When people around me asked what I thought I said \u201cit\u2019s worth trying\u201d. That was my cop out because I knew it was a good burger, and one people should try, if for no other reason than for the novelty of it, but it\u2019s not the best. But give it a shot, maybe YMMV.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569ff9457b03f5:0x57eb8765b24fca09"}

Only a wait a moment finger, be with you when I feel like it, response. The obese server(never got a name) then proceded to have a confrontational argument with my wife as to how she had to go upstairs to get tp. Clearly a dangerously overexertive venture that could have ended up in her having to sweat a bit or coronary out of existence. She never apologized, but instead imparted on the rest of the staff how unjustifiable my wife was acting. Never did a manager address the confrontation, perhaps the obese server was a manager, unknown though.  The service and managers here are elementary and lackluster to the point of ambivalent disregard of paying customers.

And here is why:\n\nWe wanted to stay true to a New England Style Lobster Roll.  So we paired our super premium ONLY claw meat (no cheap tail, head, or body meat mixed in).  With our premium lobster claw meat, we wanted to complement it\u2019s naturally sweet and hint of ocean salt flavor profile with a bun that was in it self slightly sweet.  Thus the King\u2019s Hawaiian Bakery Top Sliced Bun, which originated in Hilo Hawaii was an obvious choice for us and our Pok\u00e8 Concept.\n\nWe are using ultra premium Homarus americanus (American Cold Water Lobster) that is flown in from Boston several times a week.  So yes, the lobster meat is expensive, because it is very high quality and very tasty.\n\nAs far as the bun is concerned, traditionally the \u201cLobster Roll\u201d is made with a \u201cNew England Hot Dog Bun\u201d.  Yes they are called and classified as Hot Dog Buns. Prepared either hot or cold (ours is cold, but we can do hot if you would like) it is mixed with butter or Whole Egg Mayo, celery, and seasoning.  Then stuffed till over flowing with lobster.  Check out the below link from New England Network Magazine:\n\nhttps:\/\/newengland.com\/today\/food\/new-england-made\/new-england-style-hot-dog-rolls\/\n\nIf you happen to have a specific brand of bun you think would be a good replacement; by all means, please let me know the name.  I can source it, and start some testing (which is Restaurant talk for eating and trying).  I also would love to get you involved with the testing process for your input.\n\nPlease feel free to email me at:\n\nInfo@hitideclt.com"},"gmap_id":"0x88569f8605954569:0x3c39bbd8a0ca0f75"}

Now, a lunch for 2 is around $30. That's way too expensive for lunch for 2. I definitely don't go here as much, it has become too expensive.\n\nOriginal post:\nA huge welcome to the area!

I mean hands down crazy good!!!So if all you care about is the FOOD then they are a superb company to go with.\nNow, on a different side I had to give them 3 out of 5 because of a couple different thing. We were charged, per person, for the tasting. Whether we had gone with them or not we would have been charged for tasting. $10 a person. What we ate was not even a full plates worth that would cost $10. It wasn't a fair price in our opinion. I wish I had taken pictures to put here. Secondly, the lady was really nice to me (the bride) but was disrespectful to my mother. She belittled my mother, telling her she was wrong and basically saying she knew nothing about food just because my mom wanted some chicken with no sauce on it!!\nMy parents were going to be paying for it, and I'm sorry but you don't treat elder people that way even if they are wrong.

It was more than filling with the potatoes, corn, and sausage included! Excellent, one of the best seafood places I've had around Charlotte! I loved everything except for the cajun fries, they were crinkle cut with some sort of, almost flavorless and not very spicy, cajun seasoning. Wasn't the best but by no means was it not appetizing. They were a bit too crunchy for my liking but nevertheless, still very good. Paid a good amount but was hoping it'd be a little cheaper, but hey, seafood for the most part is pricey, regardless of where you get it from!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x885699c219744785:0x2d923609ab484502"}

I ordered the Krab and shrimp platter (spicy) and fried shrimp and red velvet waffle.  The fried shrimp were soooo good. Seasoned and fried perfectly. The red velvet, alien, mega waffle was so BIG! It was bigger than my face! It was so fluffy and moist! I don't know what the sauce was that came with it but it was so good. I guess it was butter and sugar mixed? You don't even need the sauce because the waffle was good on it's own. The Krab and shrimp platter was ok. Loaded with potatoes,  you'll definitely get full. The only thing I didn't really like was the shrimp in that platter. They were like basic Walmart shrimp, not the big ones you get from other places that have seafood boils. The staff was friendly and attentive even though I just picked up my order and left. I would definitely go back and try other menu items! I want to to try fried fish next.

Went on a date night with my boyfriend (our second one in 6 months) and we made a huge mistake going here. The second I opened the door I wanted to turn around but I figured we would give it a chance. I\u2019m not sure why I had to make a reservation to sit at the bar I was hoping it was a fancier place as the pictures online showed it to be. A basic Moscow mule was $18 , which is absolutely insane. I got a cocktail on the menu which tasted fine but nothing special for $14. We ordered muscles which took about 30 minutes and there was 4 other people in the entire restaurant. They came opened which is something I\u2019ve never heard of and they were 3x the size I\u2019ve ever seen or eaten in my life. They were overcooked, chewy and had horrible flavor . I honestly wanted to walk out and I wish we turned around the second we walked in.

King of the Sea Octopus is a must to start! Absolutely the best I've even eaten. The lamb shank is braised in a hint of fresh Mediterranean spices mixed perfectly with jasmine rice. Food is meant to be complimented with spices and that's what Deluxe does. They do not over season or dredge the food in sauces, as so many restaurants do. Not only was the food delicious, Deluxe brought a totally new experience to dining. Dishes were presented in fun, unique displays that take food to a exciting, interactive dining experience! Patrons were roaming to one another's tables, conversating and just having fun sharing one another's artful displays. It created a warm, upbeat environment that makes me want to go back tomorrow! Owner-operator-chefs Astrik & Tatiana are passionate restaurateurs & are sure to make Deluxe a Must-Go-To restaurant!

{"user_id":1.098570903e+20,"name":"Nicholas Good","rating":1,"text":"Not even mad, just incredibly disappointed... (and you know that's worse).\n\nTL;DR:\n* Slow\/Inattentive service\n* Bad drinks\n* Good, not great food\n* Overpriced\n\nWith a 7pm reservation we called ahead of time to see if it was a problem to be late and we were informed it would be fine.  We arrived closer to 7:30 and were told our table wasn't ready.  All but 1 of the tables upstairs were empty and many downstairs tables were available, 1st bad sign.\n\nAfter waiting a few minutes at the bar, we were escorted to the only table upstairs that had been used and hadn't yet been wiped or reset, while half a dozen other set tables were available all around us.  The hostess seating us didn't leave menus or say they would be back to wipe the table.  2nd bad sign.\n\nAfter a few minutes of standing next to the table trying to flag someone down we asked the server for a table wipe, she disappeared and never came back.  Another server came by, and I asked again for the table to be wiped... nearly 10 minutes at the table and we're still not properly seated or set... a few minutes go by and the 2nd server finally comes back and wipes the table and disappears.  A 3rd person, a polite blond woman comes by to offer us water and realizes there's no glasses or settings, and finally takes some initiative to set the table properly.  This is not a good start to something that bills itself as fine dining.\n\nOther tables around us begin to fill up and the tables are packed in tight.  Like so tight you can't get between rows of chairs to get to other tables, or out to the restroom... servers struggle to get to tables just go get orders let alone deliver drinks or food.  Speaking of delivering drinks, did I mention we've been at the restaurant nearly 25 minutes and our drink order hasn't been taken yet?  Of 4 drinks ordered only 1 seemed correct; 2 old fashioneds were room temp, no ice, missing any sugar or simple syrup, 1 was about half-portion, the other was about correct had there been any ice in the glass.  1 specialty drink had nearly no liquor.\n\nSince we had plenty of time to look over the menu, we ordered our food with our drinks, which then took nearly an hour to deliver, with tables sat well after us receiving their food before us.  On the plus side the food was delivered hot and beautiful.  Most of it was delicious, though the chicken was overcooked and dry.  We were satisfied with the pork chop, lamb shank, and dumplings.\n\nIt wasn't until we were done eating that our server finally asked if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks, which we declined.  We were never offered dessert.  The same polite blond who we assume to be a manager did stop by the table after 2 of us departed to ask how things were, and when she was informed about the chicken she offered to take it off the bill.  This apparently wasn't communicated to the server who brought the full bill.  2+ hours in it was beyond time to go and we paid the bill in full rather than fight to flag anyone else down to get it changed.\n\nI don't think we would have stayed for the whole meal if we hadn't been there for an event, and I doubt we'll be returning for another meal.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8856a156f2b53e23:0x12369dea142bcf80"}

Once finished paying for my order which totaled $26 I gave my number to add my points and noticed she did not put them in but continued helping the next customer. When I informed her again of my points instead of adding them to my meal she added them to her next customers meal who only paid $6 so I essentially lost points. I went in again to at 07:40am to order my usual breakfast for me and another coworker and yet again there's an issue. We ordered the Cajun Filet biscuit combos add extra crispy bacon, egg and cheese to both upsizing the meal to large. Not only is there no cheese on either sandwich the bacon is far from extra crispy.  They don't answer calls and have attitudes when you let them know they messed up something you paid for.

Bread is fresh, subs are decent, but in my opinion, a bit expensive for what you get. Enjoyed a Philly cheese steak sub, but a regular was $9.00-could have been a little larger, with more onions.\nIngredients seem to be good quality. All in all, enjoyable but not that \"special\" experience you're looking for.\nCould have stretched it 3 1\/2 stars if they offered the rating.","resp":{"time":1606871562016,"text":"Steven Have you heard about our MyMike's rewards program?

Best lo mein, sesame chicken, and crab ragoon I\u2019ve ever had, plus their sushi is fantastic too.  Never disappoints.  5 very-deserved stars.\n\nUPDATE:  They were closed for a month not long after I'd posted the above review, stated on the door that it was closed for remodeling.  After they reopened, we returned and discovered nothing at all had been remodeled, but instead the management\/ownership had been swapped out.  The food was nowhere near as good as it used to be - no resemblance whatsoever to what previously came from the kitchen.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt that it was because they'd just opened, but I'm dropping my 5 star to 3 since they were deceptive about why they were closed plus the food quality had tanked significantly.  Will try again to see if it went back to as good as it used to be.  If not, I'll let my 3 star rating ride.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88541ea0a85387ff:0xe23449c80d2e56a4"}

Choose what you want or just get a combination of anything you want. Extremely easy and you can ask for more whenever you want. Their 2 broths are awesome and very authentic. Broth gets better and better and BETTER as you dip, cook, and simmer all your ingredients. However yes you have to cook your own food and I know some \"kings and Queens\" who are very against that.

Haven't tried the hot pot, so I don't know if it has changed.

My Bento Asian Diner took advantage of a \"turn key\" location, formerly occupied by an elegant but overpriced Chinese restaurant.\n\nUpon entering we were greeted by friendly staff, paid up front for the sushi bar, settled into a nice booth, and then took our first of three trips to the sushi bar.  We started off with a simple salad with a delicious traditional Asian ginger dressing.  In order to keep their costs down, you won't find \"high end\" exotic rolls, but the sushi was fresh and very tasty. I do believe the chef will fix custom rolls upon request. Several items were tempura style, so if you're not a raw fish fan, there's plenty of items that are cooked.\n\nIf sushi is not your thing, they have a nice selection of other Asian entrees to order.  I'm sure the students of UNCC will be happy to hear of a good cheap place to eat within walking distance of the University.

All in one day... Its frustrating honestly. This wasnt the first time they ran out of food.\n\nAnother issue is how long it takes to actually get your food. I've waited up to 40 min to get my order. I've been in store and be quoted 25 min and waited over 40.\n\nLike I said, the food is good so I will continue to support this resturaunt.

They both ran around the yard and found a spot to go #\u261d\ud83c\udffb right away! As we were heading back in Alzado found a mud hole\ud83d\ude31! As I tried to call him inside he got in the mud hole and started digging\ud83d\ude2c!! I tried treats, a walk, a ball , some sticks, and getting close to slip my leash I even tried say mommas home but he was so excited to be digging in the mud hole\ud83e\udd14! I even got a pretty good mud bath\ud83d\ude02! After about a good 40 minutes of digging he finally came inside\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb! I dried him off and cleaned him off as best as I could\ud83d\ude48! When he was done he has the biggest smile on his face\ud83d\ude01! I made sure to dry Dash off as well!

I know it was an inconvenience to clean the house and wash the pups yesterday after a long day at work. We truly value you and your pups as clients and would love schedule a free 60 minute visit for you and make things right.\n\nAs specified in your client notes for the visit, our team member let the pups out for a quick potty before attempting to bring them back in for indoor play. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts (and trying the methods you mentioned via text when we reached out), we were not able to bring one of the pups back inside until the end of the visit. We have spoken to our team member to emphasize the need to reach out to our office if they're unable to get the pups sufficiently clean so we can determine a more confined place to leave them in the future.\n\nTo ensure this never happens again, I\u2019d like to update your visit routine with very specific rain instructions that our team will follow.\n\nFeel free to give me a call at (704) 343-6658 or respond to the email I sent and we can get this sorted out!"},"gmap_id":"0x8856a03ba88d260d:0x11a70676408ac325"}

I'm thinking that seeing a Mom and her 13 yr old on $6 wine night at 9pm, he was thinking yes she will need guidance. You order at the counter and pick your food up at the window when your buzzer goes off. Chicken tenders were plentiful & the chicken sandwich (homeboy maybe) was tasty. Place is loud, but it's to be expected as it's a younger crowd and in Southend. My Malbec was excellent though & I did not expect it to be.

{"user_id":1.107271636e+20,"name":"Daniel Boyce","rating":5,"text":"Good atmosphere, great service, average food, good drink options. Overall, I really enjoyed visiting this location since the staff was very attentive, and the atmosphere was nicely laid out. Currently, it's limiting when it comes to safe distance options, so the open wall to the outside along with the spacious interior allows for easy seating without feeling any pressure from being too close to others.\n\nThe walk up bar order and then pickup options are perfect since it allows the visitor to get drinks immediately from the bar while enjoying your seat wherever you choose and then pick up your food whenever it is ready.\n\nThe food options are better than expected for a bar and the quality definitely meets the expectations for the SouthEnd area. Some items aren't superior but still meet the expectations, like the Philly cheese steak that I ordered during my first visit and the chicken strips which my friend ordered. Both met the expectations of the order but neither were surprising or unique. For the cheesesteak, the bun was good but not a standard northern hoagie bun for sure and the meat was good and decent quality, but I am also rather picky when it comes to cheesesteak hoagies so I can't say it is anything different from what I'd expect being in the south.\n\nI later went back on the recommendation from management so I could try the hand pies. If you aren't familiar with a hand pie, they say it's like a fried calzone, which is a good description except for the exterior of the hand pie which is not made with a dough similar to a calzone, but instead is much closer to a traditional empanada if you've had one. It's thicker, crispier, and the bread has more flavor than what a calzone's thin dough layer would have. It's nicely drizzled with a Midwest ranch-like dressing and the filling varies, but was chicken, bacon, ranch when I went. Though this place is not somewhere I'd visit specifically for a cheesesteak hoagie, I would absolutely go back for their hand pies.\n\nI was also surprised by the quality of ingredients in their \"Greek\" sandwich. After having ordered and shared the hand pies I didn't want anything too heavy so I ordered the Greek sandwich with a side of cucumber salad. This sandwich surprised me with the quality ingredients from a place I was not initially wowed by with their cheesesteak.\n\nI got chicken for my protein which was nicely seasoned and grilled, the feta cheese was quality versus the often rubbery feta, it had freshly cut cucumbers and the black olives were full olives sliced in half and de-pitted, giving the opportunity for more of the \"Greek\" seasoning to be soaked up by the olive - increasing the flavor of each bite.\n\nThe cucumber salad was also done better than I anticipated with a nice balance of herbs and seasoning as the base layer and quality flavors that didn't make the salad too busy or overwhelming with dressing like some places do.\n\nI initially said I would go back for the drinks and atmosphere, but after a second round based on a recommendation from the owner, I'll return here again for the food as well, especially the Greek sandwich and the hand pies.","resp":{"time":1597071049104,"text":"Hi Daniel, Thank you for coming in and giving us a try!

Very good sandwich, and I would order it again, but I'm glad I expanded my horizons to try their Philly Cheesesteak, because it was better than just \"good!\" A nice chewy, toasted sub roll with a TON of meat and cheese - probably a ~10oz portion of meat, shredded up of course. I'm not usually one for peppers and onions, because I hate the texture when they are undercooked, but QCPH did it just right - you get all the wonderful flavors from the onions and the peppers, but it doesn't change the mouthfeel of the sandwich.\n\nThis Philly from QCPH is going to become a staple in my lunch rotation. It's not quite on par with Clover Joe's in Brevard Court, which I consider the best Philly in Charlotte. But it certainly takes my #2 spot!

Our prices are actually set lower than most bars and restaurants within walking distance to us for the benefit of our customers. We also include all of the taxes that you would be charged when closing out your tab in the drink price, so you don\u2019t have any surprises there. The Orange Crush is a very similar to a screwdriver which is why you might find them the same. We think our bartenders do a great job making the drinks. Our Mega Mimosa is $9 because it is a full can of Prosecco at 8.5 ounces which is a double mimosa. The average mimosa you would buy anywhere else is 4 ounces typically.

My office catered regular lunches from QC Catering over the course of a year and they were consistently bad every time. We had to schedule smaller orders because this cater was so unpopular people would rather pay for their own food over a catered, free meal.\n\nThey serve Indian food that lacks all spice or flavor.  If the chef is reading this hit me up, let me take you out to lunch at an Indian restaurant so you can learn what Tikka Masala actually tastes like.\n\nThere was also a Jambalaya meal that resembled nothing else that has ever been called jambalaya before.

It had the greasy, meaty flavor of the sausage but otherwise was lacking in any sort of spice or flavor to it. Bizarre.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569f7e3451ca87:0xe86544cb9aa50759"}

Reservations at this place really don't reserve you a table for the time you would like. It basically just puts your name on the waiting list. Manger offered to buy us a round of drinks for the wait which was a nice gesture. For the food, not impressed by the burger. $15 and then add $3 if you want a slice of cheese on it. It was rather small in size compared to other well known burger places. This was our first time here and it will be our last. Strange vibe though out the place from the staff to the other guests. If you're looking for a good burger save your money and try something from the Liberty, Peculiar Rabbit, or Kickstand.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88542080f4d2de77:0x1ed9b60e01a503fe"}

Ordered a ros\u00e9 and the pastrami sandwich with fries. First, a bit skeptical of the simplicity of the dish, but the heaping portion of meat and savory whole grain mustard won me over. I still would have liked more flair on the part of the fries, but they were crisp and who doesn't like ketchup? I was about to leave, but discovered I still had too much of the wine left in the glass, so I figured I'd get dessert. Great idea! The seared pear in a *Cheerwine* glaze with that tantalizing cashew cr\u00e9me was frellin' amazin'. Only drawback to this visit? Well, due to their dedication to sanitation, there was often a faint scent of cleaning chemicals in the air (or don't sit too close to the kitchen). Also, beware if you get the pear; the spices they use are real and I got a hearty chunk of what might have been a clove or something? Not mortal, but it cleared the sinus.

We sat outside towards the back. Pro tip. Dont sit here. We had to listen to the sewer (see pic) gargle, or whatever it was doing, the entire time. It was gross.\n\n2. Menu. Let me get this straight. If I wanted to order 2 tacos, rice and beans. That would come to a grand total of $20.00?? Tacos are a la carte with the cheapest option being $5. Rice and beans are both separate, costing $5 each...\nHow is this a sustainable business model??\nI'm willing to pay for quality, but come on. Just no.\nPacos Tacos (which is where we originally tried to go but the wait was too long) is right next door where you can get 3 tacos, rice and beans for like $14 .. with chips and salsa.\n\n3. We ended up just ordering an appetizer.. the Street Pan Nachos for $12. It was well.. underwhelming. Barely squirted on sour cream and guac paste with a minimal amount of meat and some jalapenos and nacho cheese.\nThe flavor was decent i guess.\nWe decided not to order anything else and got our bill. The app magically rung up as $13, instead of $12. Not sure what the deal with that is, but they fixed it after i mentioned it.\n\nThe service was fine. It was pretty dead while we were there.\n\nNeedless to say,  we will not be back. Good luck to this restaurant! You will need it.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569e15c1c0c447:0xb682bbc0507493d6"}

Which is surprising with as many stores as they have. They are horribly understaffed and don't appear to have the kitchen resources for its size. The food is good but could take well over an hour to get. The bar as well is understaffed and I sat with an empty glass for 43 minutes before someone asked \"are you doing ok?\" Restraining my urge to get snippy, I ordered another drink which took 15 minutes to get. There are a few employees there that are obviously trying hard to make up for the deficit but it seems like a moot point until upper management can get  a grip on what they need to make it work.

One regular,  one limited time and one bar menu. Too much going on from that respect. onion ring app was not tasty at all. Rings were greasy and doughy, the chicken sandwich was the same , greasy and not flavorful. After waiting for over 30 minutes for our food it was underwhelming to say the least\nI literally watched the cook take my chicken breast out of the deep fryer and place it on the bun, no draining at all. That was left to me to do so by procuring napkins from the bar to dab ou. One of my worst dining experiences ever. the excess grease.

The lobster was probably my least favorite. The goat cheese was my favorite. I really liked the sauces they came with too.\n\nI definitely think it's worth stopping at this food stall for some tasty empanadas.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8856a146c925026f:0xf00409a5681ead34"}

Then they had some incredibly savory fillings and a ton of options. My partner and I picked up our empanadas, walked to the car, and they smelled so good that we ate all of them immediately lol.

We sat down at approx 6:40pm and was greeted promptly and had water brought to our table. After that, no waitress to be seen for a solid 15 minutes. We ordered the lasagna and spicy chicken sausage pizza. I am not joking when I say we did not get home from dinner until 8:30 pm and we live 5 minutes from the restaurant. It was miserable. No explanation. We felt bad because we know places are struggling through covid so we gutted the wait out. We got cold lasagna served to us and only had two sheets of pasta in it. It appears they just threw ground meat and a little ricotta cheese in between two lasagna sheets of pasta. It had zero taste. The pizza was just ok, not much flavor and was a bit cold as well. I have no idea if this is the normal food people are raving about. I hate to say I completely wasted my cheat meal for the week.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569fe996ee48db:0x96cc7e8048437919"}

Order pizza as takeout and you will be happy! Do not go past 8pm. Go earlier in the day. Everyone is tired and complaining in front of you. They need a curtain to hide the kitchen staff and a space for waiters to release their frustrations and smoke. Please wait a few extra minutes before serving any table after you smoke. That smells gags people out. Take away the tv and put some tablecloths down. Put on some jazz music instead. People will pay some cash with a few upgrades.

It looked like how you would serve bruschetta if you were feeding it to barn animals - just slop on a plate. Flavors were there, but the execution was waaaayy off.

I've had plum cake many times before and this didn't quite stack up, but was still very good. What I did like about it was that it wasn't too sweet and had a nice touch of tang from the plums.

There was only one other couple there the entire time we were there (we left shortly after 7).\n\nThere's a few different options for ordering. We went with the smallest\/cheapest which was the 4 course option for $105 each (2 appetizers, 1 entree, 1 dessert).\n\nSince we were celebrating our anniversary, they brought us a complementary glass of prosecco which was very nice.\n\nPrior to the first appetizer, they brought us a broccolini soup shooter which was very good. For our first appetizer, we both got the She Crab Soup. We wanted to try the Artichoke Soup, but they were out. We loved the She Crab Soup though.\n\nPrior to our second appetizer, the brought us a cheese bread with rosemary butter that was delicious. For our second appetizer we got the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake and the Pork Belly. The Crab Cake was the best I've ever had and one of the highlights of the meal. The Pork Belly was the only thing we were disappointed with. It was over cooked and not tender like pork belly should be.\n\nPrior to our entree, they brought us a salted caramel sorbet which was very good. For our entrees, we got the Rosemary & Dijon Crusted Rack of New Zealand Lamb and the Pan Seared Scallops. Both were excellent. The lamb was tender and the scallops cut like butter. During the course, they also brought us a biscuit with rosemary butter that was very good.\n\nFor dessert, we got the Hazelnut Cr\u00e8me Brulee and the Caramel and Apple Cheesecake. The Cr\u00e8me Brulee was very good and done perfectly, but the cheesecake was the star of the show. It was light and fluffy with a caramel apple sauce. It was the best cheesecake I've ever had.\n\nOur top four dishes of the night were the crab cake, scallops, rack of lamb, and cheesecake.\n\nTo end the evening, they brought me a rose!\n\nThey do valet parking, but we found street parking easily.

They couldn't find our reservation, though they confirmed by phone earlier in the day and the day before.  So we stood in the foyer awkwardly for a while.\n\nWe added the wine pairing to our meal and the wines were nice. The sommelier was nice, but very distant and it felt like he couldn't be bothered. We had a few questions about the wine, but determined pretty quickly that though he was polite, we were not the priority.\nThe first 2 courses and the amuse bouche were really good, but my entree and my husbands were not that great at all.  His was average, mine was not good.  I got gnocchi and they were tough. The sauce was bland and a little salty.\n\nWe spent $350 on this meal and it was really, really disappointing.  The house was very cute\/vintage and shabby chic... but that isn't enough. McNinch is a Charlotte institution and we were both so excited to try it out.

It taste great although it lacked enough of the proteins and the wings were good. The problem was the egg drop soup that was obviously not egg drop soup. When getting home I opened the bag to a egg drop soup that wasn't yellow at all and was almost clear with eggs floating in it and very thin. Upon tasting the soup it was clear they gave me chicken noodle broth with eggs dropped in it and it was purely disgusting. I would have rathered the tell me they didn't have it then give me what they obviously threw together.

Thought we'd give Papa John's pizza a try.\n\nI spent quite a bit of money and discovered a few things:\n\nThe sausage on the medium pizza's tasted like breakfast sausage-not Italian sausage. Totally ruined the flavor of the pizza. I asked for light sauce on one and regular on the other. Pizza's were made to that request and I know this because (see next issue)\n\nI asked for light sauce on the Chicken Veggie pizza, it was not light. In fact you could see it under the cheese and particularly thick at the edges of the crust.\n\nI don't know why anyone would pay for \"priority pass delivery\" when it still takes 39-49 minutes for delivery. Not piping hot, but still sorta warm. I think pizza may have delivered around 30-35 minutes but still, what a mislead.\n\nCrust on all pizzas, while tannish on the bottom, was very chewy in the center and tough as nails on the outer edges. This is signature pizza?\n\nDelivery girl was very nice and I don't mind the 6$ tip. That is the best thing I can say about Papa John's nasty pizza.\n\nWhat a huge disappointment and waste of money. My husband, myself, my grand boys (who eat just about everything and really like pizza) were all starving and this pizza was such a let down. Honestly, I don't know how this passes for pizza or why the Papa John's chain is so popular. Do we just shove food in our faces and not care how it tastes or what it costs? It all went in the garbage last night. I'm sure when the raccoons realize it's in there they'll enjoy it.\n\nI joined the Papa Johns online club but will be cancelling that. I won't be back. I'd like to get my money back but I have a feeling Papa will be keeping that. You got me and you got me good.

I suggest either olive garden or Maggiano the next time you guys would like to have Italian American food, instead of italian and Mediterranean."},"gmap_id":"0x885420916ea6fd0f:0x86612608c3b6b728"}

We shared two salads (ensalata caprese and a roasted beet salad) that were delicious and ample for four people. Two of us had the penne bolognese and two had pappardelle with a wild boar sauce. We all loved our dishes. I especially appreciated the fact that the penne was cooked just right - al dente! We also shared two desserts - a chocolate tart and a pistachio tart and they were wonderful as well.\n\nWe will definitely return and we might just have to try Butta la Pasta one week night.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x885420916ea6fd0f:0x86612608c3b6b728"}

First off the atmosphere upon entry is very welcoming, there are menus available outside and as plenty of menu boards inside, and there is tons of brand recognition around the restaurant.  Prices are reasonable and easy to understand, the staff was pleasant and respectful, easy to order and ask questions. The pizza is made directly in front of you, payment is made at the end, and it only took maybe 6 - 10 minutes from when we started our order to have a fresh hot pizza sitting in front of us. Now onto the pizza, it was amazingly good, the crust had just right amount of crisp to it, the cheese was perfect, and the toppings we had we're fresh. Jalapenos even had some heat to them, that's usually hit or miss at pizza establishments. To finalize this review, our 7 year old said:  \"It was better than Brixx and he would definitely be coming back!\" Haha, we are a pizza loving family.

We were greeted by one of the employees that worked there by the name of Kayla and we expressed to her that it was our first time. She then provided us with information based on the food that they sell. After looking at the menu and placing our order, we went and found our table. Our food came out very efficiently and was amazingly delicious! We were then greeted by the store owner Emily who then took it upon herself to ask us, \"how the food tasted?\" and then came back to ask us \"to sample their bacon mac and cheese\" and we agreed. That was also very satisfying to our tastebuds. I would truly recommend this place. Sidenote: Their restroom is very clean, and you know what they say about restaurants having a clean restroom.

My only issue was that I got the burger cooked medium rare and it came out medium well. I'm was still delicious though so I can only imagine how much better it would have been if it were cooked right. The toppings were really good. The pimento cheese was sweet which was a little weird. I got green beans as my side which were pretty good.\n\nI was able to sample someone else's chicken tenders which were really good and I heard the casserole of the day was very good as well.\n\nThe service wasn't great. I couldn't get a refill of water and it took a long time for us to get our checks and pay.\n\nThe decor is very rustic and southern inspired with a lot of wood.

I got a coffee which tasted terrible. It was extremely weak. It was so bad that I asked our waitress about it. She said they didn\u2019t have any other coffee and she didn\u2019t charge me for it which was nice. I have never complained about coffee.\n\n3. My mom asks for extra cheese in her skillet. There did not seem to be extra cheese in her dish when compared to mine. When the bill came there was a $1.50 charge for the extra cheese. We should have been warned about the charge or not charged.\n\n4. My brother ordered a hamburger cooked medium. It was brown throughout. When you are paying $16 for a hamburger it should be cooked right.\n\nOn the plus side, everything looks really nice.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569f8727505555:0x995da44c69f95710"}

We were also told to try the nabs and the cream pie also absolutely amazing.  We loved it so much we had to come back before traveling back home to MN.  The staff is absolutely amazing.

The decor is undistinguished but pleasant enough.\nI had an old fashioned from the cocktail menu.  It had the perfect quantity of fruit and bitters,  but was way too sweet for me... too much simple syrup. I ordered a separate straight bourbon to add to it to diffuse the sweetness, but when my waitress learned why, I was doing that she insisted on bringing me a corrected one. \"No,\" she said, \"it's your drink. You deserve it to be how you want it.\" How lovely! The replacement was perfect.\nOverall that waitress was fabulous. She was knowledgeable, conversant (appropriately), and very helpful. She was also training a new employee and it was fun to see how she included the newbie as she presented out options. A real pro.\nRather than an entree, I had just an app. Their selection of appetizers or small plates is disappointing, though admittedly that's not their stock in trade. I settled on the \"pick 3\". You pick any three cheeses or meats - from a fairly impressive charcuterie selection - and you also get nuts, spread, & bruschetta. They shorted me the honey mustard spread described on the menu, but the cherry jam was better anyway. It was beautifully presented on a butcher board.\nMy companion and I lingered over several rounds of drinks and we did not feel at all rushed.\nI'll go back, and I suspect this restaurant will make it, despite the intense competition of the restaurant\/bar scene in Charlotte.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88569f8727505555:0x995da44c69f95710"}

Didn't care for how sweet the wingz were as I was expecting a more savory profile. Would have been five stars but the portions for sides is quite small and I find their cocktails to be overpriced for a restaurant of this genre. I pay 15 for drinks that include a rooftop, 4 and 5 star dining, or some other memorable dining experience such as live instrumentation. This restaurant while cute isn't a fancy enough place in my opinion to warrant the price they charge for adult beverages. That part left a sour taste in my mouth which would mostly make me pass on dining again as libations are a part of my enjoyment when out socializing. Too many other options that offer more complete dining experiences at competitive pricing.

I ordered the South African special of the day which was OK, it came out kind of lukewarm but they were super busy so it is forgiven. I also ordered the loaded sweet potato and everything on that is super Yum except for that they piled it high with steamed greens which have almost no flavoring. They could do well to quarter the amount of greens and saut\u00e9 them with some soy sauce or another spicy flavor. As is -I would pass. However, the barista made me a ginger vanilla iced latte that is hands-down one of the best drinks I\u2019ve ever had in my life. I\u2019ve had other African drinks that feature ginger and lemon and love the real and freshness of the ingredients. I would go there explicitly for this latte again.\nThe photo is from when the staff came out and did an impromptu South African line dance. Was such a happy atmosphere and every everyone was laughing and clapping. Sweet and lively, the outdoor area of this place is quintessential Noda and I will definitely be back.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88541fa1fe6577ed:0x466044c418a9931e"}

My Jet's experience was the exact oopposite of what I had read: the service I received was GREAT!  Maybe they took heed to past feedback. All I know is the person answering my call was pleasant, professional & efficient. My order arrived in 30-40 mins, far less time than I was quoted (pleasant surprise! ).  The delivery person was pleasant,  had change & the pizza was fresh,  hot.\nMore on the pizza itself: THE BEST I've had here in Charlotte,  hands down... Better by far than Toppers,  Papa Johns,  Dominoes. In fairness, I haven't had Pizza Hut since arriving here, but it is at least AS good as any PH pizza I have had in my life in other cities... The flavor & consistency of the crust, sauce gives Jets an overall edge, even over PH. The PRICE (value) is definitely better than anyone else around serving decent pizza.  Also, they have good specials. I've been trying to find the \"IT\" pizza spot in Charlotte &  had grown frustrated, weary in that effort.  However, delayed is not denied... I found it today.  Unless this was an exceptional experience, which I hope is not the case, Jet's Pizza is definitely the winner. Without question, I will go back again & again! It's so refreshing to give a review of an exceptional experience instead of protesting sub-standard, unsatisfactory service!

The wings are crispy and meaty, and the sauces are diverse and great. Seen a lot of love for strawberry spice on other reviews and I can agree. But, as a spice guru, I've got to be say that their spiciest sauce, the \"challenge sauce\" is about a 6\/10 on the spice scale. Imagine that Frank's Red Hot is a 2\/10. Even so, the challenge sauce has great flavor and I'll definitely be back for more.\n\nI'm really pleased with this place.\n\nEdit 11\/24\/20: After teasing the owner that his \"challenge wings\" are weaksauce, I returned and he made them himself. Though I still didn't have to touch my water while eating the wings, they were significantly spicier (about 8\/10) and kept a great flavor.\n\nAnd the owner was a good sport about it.\n\nI really love this place.\n\nEdit 12\/12\/20: I returned to my favorite local wing joint and was once again presented with the owner's latest batch of \"challenge wings.\" And this batch brought tears to my eyes while remaining delicious.

{"user_id":1.00947986e+20,"name":"Brittany Adams","rating":1,"text":"So today my friend and I went to this restaurant and were treated horrible. When we arrived we found two chairs at the bar and sat down. The place was not packed at all, yet we were COMPLETELY ignored by the bartender and two gentleman cleaning glasses. It felt almost intentional. Not wanting to be antsy or come off as aggressive, we waited for several minutes as the bartender came and went, doing what appeared to be her absolute best to ignore us. Then, a couple came up to the bar and as soon as she noticed them she went right over and acknowledged them. Now I'm only stating this part because this is what it felt like: My friend and I are African American women and the couple appeared to be Caucasian. Again I am not 100% sure this is why we were ignored when we initially sat down and they were greeted almost instantly upon coming to the bar, but it felt bad. So after waiting several minutes finally my friend says, \"Can someone please help us? We've been waiting\". So both of the guys cleaning the glasses looks up. One guy said something so ridiculous! He goes, \"I saw you guys having a conversation and didn't want to interrupt\". Since when does a server or bartender not come check in with you when you arrive at an establishment they're working at? So we basically brushed him off because the comment was so ridiculous and then the other gentleman cleaning (who was possibly a manager) asked us what we wanted to drink and placed our order then eventually came back and placed our food order. No apology for being ignored, no acknowledgement of the behavior from the young lady behind the bar, who by the way continued to ignore us our entire visit. I'm just trying to understand what we did to deserve the treatment we received. Did they assume we weren't going to tip our something? It was madness. Never returning to this establishment again and I will be sure to let everyone I speak to know to do the same. The food is also not that great.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8856a10c94274141:0xd16bcaf56513a725"}

Being that El Thrifty is in Optimist Hall, Charlotte's food hall with many outstanding food options. I fully expected great flavors and atmosphere. The main positive is the atmosphere. Other than that, the food was tasteless, small and outright dissatisfying.\nI wont comment on staff since it is soft opening and mistakes and waits are expected at this point. (Still annoying however)\nThe pictures on Google are not from this location. They are from the Greenville location. That being said, this is the second location opened. Why is the food so bland if recipes are already tried and true?\nSoft opening or not (only covers for operational and staffing flaws) the food should be up to par.\nMeat was dry and tasteless. Ceviche was tasteless. Salsa was over salted. Torta was dry and flavorless. 4$ tacos have very little meat that tastes like nothing. Just all around very disappointing for our party and a $100 check. I would have rather went inside and ate Optimist Halls existing great food and came down to El Thrifty for drinks and games. We will not be returning for food.\nDo yourself a favor and go for games\/drinks not food.","resp":{"time":1571100639144,"text":"Charles, thank you for your feedback.

Not a huge selection, but you could find something that you would like (even though they were out of two of their IPAs)\n\nThe tacos were mediocre. We had two al pastor tacos, a shrimp taco and a steak taco. The tortillas all fell apart as we were eating them. The shrimp was probably the best, but still not something I would go back to eat. The al pastor tasted like it was unseasoned chicken with pineapple sprinkled on it. The steak was chewy.\nThe seasoned veggies were just mushy zucchini and squash with some corn and a touch of aioli.\n\nIt looked like the games would have been fun, but the area with the bowling and everything was closed for a private party when we were there.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a good concept for a fun night.

They have tsukumen ramen here, the only place I know in Charlotte that has this on their menu. It's a ramen where the broth is much more condensed and you dip the ramen noodles into the bowl. It amazing especially on warmer days when a hot bowl of ramen is a bit too much. Since the tsukumen is shio (salt) based, it's much lighter compared to it's contemporaries such as tonkotsu or miso. They also include those as well on it's menu. Their ramen toppings include ajisuke tamago, the flavored and slightly runny hard-boiled egg, for their ramen, which no other restaurant in Charlotte has. The ramen was also not the only thing they served, they had Korean fried chicken, both boneless and traditional, which were amazing, and you had options to make them spicy or mild. Soy garlic will always be my favorite. Definitely a recommend if you are in the area or craving japanese ramen or Korean fried chicken.","resp":{"time":1575150225882,"text":"Thanks for choosing Roppongi Ramen Bar!

The dumpling skin was nice and thin and the filling tasted great!\nI also had the shio ramen and the spicy garlic Korean fried chicken. The shio ramen  was a little small for the price, but the broth tasted amazing, the chashu pork was deliciously roasted, the noodles were not over done giving it a great texture. The soft boiled egg was perfectly cooked as well. The spicy garlic Korean fried chicken was amazing. The crispy breading tasted of tempura style, very light and crunchy. The glaze packed a lot of flavor, but personally not enough spice. On the table was dried garlic and an asian hot pepper spice blend to go on the ramen. Both were very aromatic and added a lot to the dish.\nOverall, I would rate this as one of my favorite restaurants in the area.

This is a small hole in the wall place serving ramen and korean fried chicken. They have 4 kinds of ramen, and 3 kinds of friend chicken. We tried the chicken family platter, which had original,  soy garlic and dakgangjung. the soy garlic was my favorite. The regular fried chicken was extra crunchy and really tender but bland. It just needed a little salt or flavor and it would be my go to. Overall the chicken was pretty good, the gyoza was meh (pork is the only flavor id consider ordering a second time). I didnt try the ramen but my friend said it was delicious. Will definitely try the ramen in the future. Inside is capitol T tiny. There are 3 bar sections that seat about 3 each, 2 tables that seat 4, 1 table that seats 8 and 2 tables that seat 2. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated at a table with 4 other people we didnt know, but sti felt like we had enough space. The menu is very small but quality over quantity i guess.  There pork bun isnt my speed. I like more traditional style and this was more of a gourmet take with a slice of pork, a slice of cucumber, some greens and a super sweet sauce instead of the stuffed sweet bun style i prefer. They have 3 types of gyoza, seaweed salad and i think one other appetizer (kimchi i think). All told i think they have less than 15 items on their menu. The fried sweet potato was really good with the chicken but the menu states it comes with cole slaw and it didnt. The dakgangjung chicken was clearly made with almonds and peanuts. One of my friends is mildly allergic to almonds, but i asked what the dusting on top was made of because it looked like more than just those two nuts sliced It looked like white shavings of something, with a texture i couldnt quite place. When our waiter asked the ched, as soon as he found out my friend was allergic to almonds he tried to deny there were almonds, which there clearly were. We were more curious about what the shavings were we couldnt figure out, but denying something like that could be really dangerous for someone with a more serious allergy....","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88542152d6f69a35:0xf81bcf55979658c1"}

What was ok, was the meat of the burger and the fries were nothing special to write home about. What I did not like, was that the manager assured me everything was in the bag, but she forgot condiments that I had paid extra for. The other thing was the bun of the burger. If this bun was warm\/fresh\/off the grill soft the burger probably would have been spot on. However, I was given a burger that had a bun that did not seem fresh\/super soft\/warm.

It was beautifully done.\nThe first bite and every bite after was equally distributed with meat, cheese, pickles, sauces and bun. Not one bite was lacking.\nAnd the cheese.....holy moly. I think this is probably the best hamburger cheese on the tour. So melty and so good.\nThe fries were just regular fries. Nothing to write home about but they were perfectly cooked and perfectly salted. So that's a win.\nThe burger and the fries were huge.

Well... it\u2019s here, and it\u2019s delicious! First of all, someone needs to do a case study on their branding because it is AMAZING! Before you\u2019ve even taken a bite, you know all about what they\u2019re about, who they do it for, and why they do it. And the design of their menus, bags (even down to the green staples), drink cups, straws, and the overall customer experience has been given some major forethought! The burgers are great! The patties are seasoned extremely well although they are a little on the flat side of things. If it\u2019s your first time, I would recommend trying the double, as this comes out to be the height of most single patty burgers elsewhere (and personally, a better patty to bun ratio if you ask me). Whatever sauce is on the burger is heavenly and I\u2019m loving the pickles! The grilled red onions make for a nice crunchy finish. Finally, the fries are incredible on their own. No doubt, the branding on the fry sauce containers like the Dilly Ranch and Garlic Rosemary Aioli are cool... but I find the fries to be best on their own with no sauce. Your mileage may vary, however... but why mess with something that\u2019s fairly close to perfection? You know? This place gets high marks and is a welcome addition to the already amazing food lineup at Optimist Hall!\n\n- Adam from @appetiteandadventure","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8856a14c10b093f5:0x8240e40db3834369"}

My wife opted for the single patty\/no onion and was equally as happy.\n\nThe burger as it comes isn\u2019t the most common combination of toppings - but it\u2019s unique and exactly what I was hoping for. Everything balances out nicely and I\u2019d put it in the comfort food category.\n\nI read some reviews complaining about price or comparing Harriets to Ace #3... couple thoughts: Optimist Hall is fairly expensive for what you get, but you\u2019re paying for the accessibility and ambience. And you should know that going in. I don\u2019t think $9 for a quality burger is crazy - you\u2019d pay more at a restaurant. As far as Ace, I think Ace is slightly better but I think that\u2019s because it\u2019s a more traditional take on a burger. Ace is definitely greasier - which I don\u2019t always appreciate.\n\nThe fries and sauces at Harriets are definitely better than Ace. Try both, debate among friends, and keep supporting both!!

Go to Ace if you want a burger, go to Papi Queso if you want a tasty sandwich in Optimist Hall. Harriet's ain't it.\n\nPresentation: 5\/5\nFlavor: 1\/5\n\nBurger: Coming in at $12 for a double with cheese, Harriet's misses the mark. The bun is good, but the meat is flavorless and really overwhelmed by the cheese. The cheese is by far the best part, which isn't a good thing when talking about a burger. If I can find the brioche, I can actually make this at home; there was none of that crispy carmelization I expected. The only toppings were onions and pickles. It wasn't \"bad\"...but it also wasn't good.\n\nFries: The texture was great, but the taste was non-existent. Think Burger King style, but with a low salt Wendy's taste. The ketchup container was awkwardly tall for dipping, but also not ideal for pouring out. Also wasn't \"bad\", but not a flavor I would ever crave.\n\nI guess it's cool to have a burger joint in Optimist Hall, but I expected much more from Papi Queso, as everything on their menu is full of unique, balanced flavors. Rosemary Fries > Harriet's fries. Why not do a pepper or seasoned salt fry? It seems like branding and speed were the key objectives, and the result is a fast food burger rather than a diner style.

It is imperative to note that we absolutely take the current state of this worldwide pandemic very seriously. As you can imagine opening a new restaurant during these times has it's challenges, and we want to ensure we are able to roll out a proper take out system after we have honed our expertise and focus on the guests dining in with us. With that being said we are absolutely going to be offering take out via our website after the New Year. We hope that when we do you will give us a shot and enjoy some awesome Tex Mex cuisine.

They have two small tables with some extra chairs, so we were able to make it work without taking it to go.\n\nThere are several things on the menu that looked good other than wings, but I had to get wings. My husband and I split 20 wings which came with fries. Typically, you can get two different sauces for 20 wings, but they let me get 4 for a couple dollars more. I got the Triple Whammy (sweet BBQ & spicy sweet and sour), All Purpose (Asian Polynesian with a kick), Crown Town (Lemon Pepper with Buffalo sauce), and Barbalo (Buffalo\/BBQ).\n\nThey were all quite good, but my ranking would be: All Purpose, Triple Whammy, Barbalo, Crown Town. I probably wouldn't get Crown Town again because it just tasted like Buffalo sauce. I couldn't taste the Lemon Pepper at all. I loved the others. They were unique flavors and quite tasty. The fries were my favorite kind of fries. They were battered, crispy, and full of flavor.\n\nWe got our food pretty fast and you could get sides of ranch and blue cheese.

Moved here almost 5 years ago and have been a strong advocate for Wing King on S Tryon, BUT these wings put WK to shame.
