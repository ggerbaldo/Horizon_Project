Why does everyone love that place in east nashville? This is a far better burger, at 1-3 dollars more. And the fries are much better too, yes, even better than those tater tots. The flavor on the meat mixed with the carefully picked out mix of toppings is decadent, and the short, thin garlic fries that come with complement it beautifully. I would make the bun a bit more stiff though, since as tasty as it is, it kind of falls apart with the force I grab my burger..... ha.\n\nOverall, best burger in Nashville.

The waiters were all very attentive and friendly; we very rarely had an empty glass! Not to mention the waiter was nice enough to take a couple group photos for us! My coworkers had the Crab Cakes, the chicken salad, and I got the strip steak and they were both delicious! Especially the crab cakes! I would highly recommend them for sure!

He came back 10 mins later and noticed that we hadn't been waited on so he got us another round of mimosas and our waiter. By that time were ready to order. We didn't see our actual waiter again until we got our check. The other guy served us the whole time so we tipped him. Btw, the food was ok at best and I would've had better service and food at IHOP.

It was a quick drive downtown from Old Hickory, where we live and we come across a cute unassuming building.  This is where it gets good! Not only did they have 5 DELICIOUS soups, made by a Mr.Cornelius, that the lovely, very pleasant and extremely helpful Miss Puff let us try without hesitation. But, they also have the best Reuben I have had in years, along with several other sandwich choices, another man Mr.Tristan,prepared fresh and quick for us. My son got a spinach wrap and we also split a KILLER chicken philly. He loved the brocoli and cheddar soup and my chicken quesadilla was phenomenal too. They offer fresh fruit and an array of cold salads as well. They are located in the heart if downtown nestled in very chill out of the way spot, for those wanting to decompress on your lunch break, and just a few blocks from the walking bridge if you want to chew while looking over the river, like we did yesterday.

It was cold as a polar bear's @$$!\nI was extremely patient since I was with a party of 6. I was very embarrassed due to it was my idea to go to Logan's. I finally went and asked for a manager. The manager got our food to the table finally and apologized for our delay. This is unacceptable if you plan to stay in business. Once we had eaten and we're offered dessert we asked for them to go, again the waiter brought the wrong items and they were not packed in to go boxes, after this was specifically requested ahead of time.\nThen after twice coming back to the table twice with carrot cake when cheesecake was requested, the waiter came with an empty to go dessert box and sat it on a table behind us and walked away!!! I'm convinced he must do meth or crack because his elevator obviously does not reach every floor. We finally left  and with the desire to not return to Logan's anytime soon. Jeesh...

The coleslaw was fresh and tasted housemade, as did the buttermilk ranch. The beans were good, a little clumpy though. The biggest surprise was the chicken. The chicken was not on par with comparable restaurants in my opinion. The seasoning was spicy, but lacked the taste of Nashville Hot Chicken (brown sugar most notably). The chicken also was not a juicy and\/or greasy as other restaurants, which is what makes Nashville Hot Chicken great. The bread underneath was alright, but the dish was missing pickle slices.

I don\u2019t actually care about that though. This place is so good I don\u2019t have to look any further. I also can\u2019t spell what I normally get but it has milanesa, avocado, pickled carrots, chorizo, and a load of other things. It\u2019s the kind of sandwich I take a break from and finish later in the day. Also for a sandwich that size and a cold soda, it\u2019s roughly $10. You will not be disappointed.\n\nALSO, despite the language barrier, which the staff seemed more than eager to try and overcome, my experience went smooth when ordering and getting my food. Sometimes it can be hard when ordering from a Latin establishment but they really do a great job acclimating to someone who doesn\u2019t speak their native tongue. Super friendly as well.

Even though we had our doubts we ended up staying anyways and we actually had fun surprisingly. We didn't know what to expect\nHowever, I will say be careful in the parking lot because there was a weirdo who pulled up next to us while we were leaving. Then he followed us and finally gave up. I felt like he was trying to block us in but I told my friend to drive! Just be aware of your surroundings and thats for anywhere you go.

The buns stay together which is hard to find in gluten free breads. I also like that you can choose not to have Parmesan on their sweet potato fries, which means they don't make a huge batch like most restaurants. Everything seems to be done fresh. The music they play is perfect. It gives the place a relaxed feel. It's got a lot of great oldies that you almost want to stand up and slow dance to \ud83d\ude09 ... if you so feel inclined. I think price wise they run the same as a upper class restaurant which isn't bad in comparing gluten free to non gluten free restaurants. Burgers are around 10-14 bucks. Entrees more (haven't had one yet.) Trust me when I say this is well worth the visit and time for anyone even if they don't have a gluten allergy.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x886465d3ef163be5:0x4da4a38181dd555b"}

The AC system was not working properly, the credit card terminal was not working properly, and although the service started out good, it fell down about halfway through. In addition the french toast looked better than it tasted. It just needed a little more flavor (other than the fruit) to save it. No ice in the water might be a good idea when the AC is working, but as it was there needed to be a bucket of ice provided to the table upon seating.

{"user_id":1.175521534e+20,"name":"Jordan Dallmann","rating":5,"text":"By far my favorite cafe in Nashville. In my opinion a great cafe needs to excel at three things: Food, Coffee, and (of course) Alcohol. Many restaurants have some of them, but rarely do you see the gem of an establishment that is on point with all three. They have a very solid cheeseburger with amazingly crispy potatoes, and some healthy options like the farro grain bowl (surprisingly my favorite). Their coffee and bar program is where they really shine though. They have all the classic espresso drinks as well as  augmented coffee creations; basically house made coffee cocktails (with and without alcohol). Service is great overall, especially at the bar; albeit a bit slower on busy days while at a table. The space is large and chic with very comfortable bar stools and chairs and a large outdoor patio which will hopefully open soon. Seriously though, great food, delicious coffee, and badass cocktails.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x886467111138387f:0x5e4e7fb63786c5f1"}

Owner said the company was in the process of relocating so I didn't bother going inside. At pick up, he upsaled the 1Q21 That was just added to the menu recently so I opted for one more bottle on the spot. Order process was incredibly easy and pick was smooth as can be. Only thing is this particular pick up location is a little hard to get too traffic wise. Can't wait to *responsibly* enjoy these products! Wanted to add a special note here, on the original order the company had said the Tepache-Shu was out of stock, but when I expressed to them that was exactly what I was interested in, they took time to provide exactly what I ordered.

{"user_id":1.164437391e+20,"name":"Sean Smith","rating":4,"text":"Overall this place is very good, my only criticism is that the brisket has been different every time, but never quite *right*.  One time it was thin slices that were on the tough and dry side, then the next time the brisket was in chunks and was way too fatty and greasy to the point it was just unpleasant.  I'm good with a fair amount of fat on my BBQ because, well, it's BBQ - but this way over the line to where I almost felt cheated out of meat for all the fat it had.\n\nI don't want to come across as overly negative because literally everything else is first-rate: good pork, good sides, good sauces and good service.  Even the sandwich buns are a cut above the typical generic hamburger bun!

Greeter\/server was very nice and attentive. Made recommendations when I was unsure of what to order. And did not rush me to order or pay.\nI ordered the House Special Shawarma Wrap with a Greek salad\nWrap was yummy. With every bite I was trying to guess what flavor I was tasting. All the ingredients complemented each other not one overwhelmed my tastebuds. The chicken in the wrap was deliciously grilled, I could have ate that by itself.\nSalad was basic side said with romaine lettuces, tomatoes,olives, cucumber and feta cheese with Italian dressing (I would have preferred cucumber base dressing instead)\nAlso ordered a fruit juice. Apple, carrots, orange with a little ginger. It was very refreshing.\nFood portions were large. I was stuffed when I left.\nPrices were reasonable plus there is a sign saying they will start having lunch buffet, which would allow you to taste the different foods they have available.\nI highly recommend this establishment.

It's funny, we seem to I think that these coffee shops that are attached to gas stations don't serve decent coffee. This is not the case here! Their coffee blends are fresh, nothing aggressively bitter or undrinkable, and the service is spot-on! This is a great experience to actually have a cup of coffee and not just another Starbucks experience. Lots of options to choose from, including custom blends of java. Only a couple employees but good people. The kitchen area is clean and looks like a kitchen, stainless and utilitarian, not a stage for a pompous barista but a workplace for a humble, hardworking employee. Selections are pricey but less than the other guys and not crazy. This is what you deserve in a coffee place!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x886467cbb93a9933:0x6c5c2b955a522bf6"}

We were very much looking forward to going back again. We went again in May 2021 and got 3 drinks and the seafood dip with chips and everything was pretty bad. We didn't finish any of the drinks or the seafood dip. We were planning on having dinner there but it was so bad that we left and ate at slim and huskys instead. They have a very deep whiskey menu but everything is extremely overpriced. If you do go for whiskey go on Wednesday where everything is half price and you cam get a decent deal. The rarer stuff is still crazy expensive though. Stagg is like 65 bucks for example. I am torn if we go a third time since the first time was great and the second time was awful.","resp":{"time":1621886996446,"text":"Hi Jesse, it is so nice to hear that you enjoyed your first visit to The 404 Kitchen!

The biscuits were cold and dry, nearly as hard as an Oregon trail tack biscuit. If there was bourbon butter involved, I couldn't tell you-- there was no taste. The beef tenderloins bark\/crust was too much. The turkey was overpowered by smoke. The potatoes lacked flavor. Both types of stuffing were dry. The ham looked so dry I didn't try it. There was a salad that seemed to have been tossed with Sarghento cheese snack sticks.\nThe service was good. The hostesses were aloof and I felt bad for them.\nThe restaurant took too many reservations for Thanksgiving apparently, regardless of our reserved times we were all kept waiting with the excuse that \"people were taking longer that we thought.\" Well, yeah. People are going to take time to enjoy a family meal.\nThe magician was nowhere to be found. Allegedly he was there, but I can't prove it.

The restaurant itself is comfortable, not too noisy and great for small or larger group. Food was a little disappointing for all the great reviews and great menu items. There was this great aroma of smoking pork throughout the restaurant coming from their Big Green Egg on the patio, which set appetites very high and made you want whatever dish that smoked pork would be turned into. Come to find the pork is chopped into the tiniest pieces and made into a pea salad where you completely lose that desired southern smoked pig. The possibilities and potential here is high!

They lost our reservation, the seating was uncomfortable and the food was just okay. The bolognese was greasy, the polenta was over seasoned and the cornbread was burnt.

It took 30 minutes to order food, the food was late in arriving, everyone's order was wrong, some of the food was disgustingly under-cooked.

{"user_id":1.08890101e+20,"name":"john stephenson","rating":2,"text":"I am going to preface this review with 3 things. I was a chef for nearly 30 years, I now work in the food distribution end of things, and I hate male servers.\nAlthough i had not been to a Red Robin in years my non meat eating 8 year old daughter had recently told me she liked their grilled cheese. We were close by, were looking for something different than our usual, and I had memories of thick juicy cooked to temp burgers with a variety of different toppings floating around in my head. She agreed with the choice and off we went.\nWe were quickly greeted and seated. From there it went down hill. Our server then showed up, never introduced himself, and asked what we would like to drink. My daughter spotted the sparkling lemonade and wanted one. I wasn't wanting to pay $4.50 for a lemonade I knew she would not finish. At no time did unnamed waiter mention there was a child size. I found that out when I recieved the bill. The look on his face at this point in time is not a happy one as he has gotten the impression that I am cheap meaning he is not going to make much off me.  He mildly attempts to upsell us on an app. I have been sick the last several day and am being careful of what i eat so i pass on said app.\nOur drinks arrive quickly. First thing i notice is the $4.50 sparkling lemonade has frozen not fresh strawberries in it. So much for \"gourmet\". It does taste good though, not too sweet not too sour. My root beer tastes as it should.\nThe unnamed waiter then asks if we need more time or if we are ready. I say i am ready and place our order. I order the Royale burger no cheese, my daughter gets her grilled cheese and fries. After the unnamed waiter walks away and is gone for a few minutes I realize he asked neither how I like my burger done nor my egg.\nAs we wait for what I would consider a bit too long for our food, the waiter(a different one not Mr. Unnamed) comes up to his large party table and exclaims for the whole restaurant to hear, \" I have all your separate checks for you, here they are(all stacked in a bunch in his had as he sets the on the table). He then continues in his very loud voice \" I just want to tell you how much, and I am not just saying this, but how much I truly enjoyed serving you\". If you really enjoyed serving them that much then man up and distribute those individual checks to each person correctly! Gourmet this is not.\nMy daughter is now wondering where her food bbn is and why it is taking so long. Around this time I notice something somewhere touting \"kids eat first\". Yeah our food came out together. Mr. Unnamed served the table across from us and let us know our food would be out soon.\nIt did arrive shortly thereafter. I picked my burger up and bit into it. Before I could most of my egg yolk was thankfully on the plate instead of me wearing it(this is why I prefer over hard on my burger). Looking at the burger after biting I to it showed well done, i prefer medium.  The \"tomato\" was barely big enough to find and lacked much if any flavor. It appears long gone are the juicy thick patties of yore and they have been replaced with thin frozen patties instead. The party was on the dry side had no flavor nor signs of being seasoned.  Overall it was very mediocre for being \"gourmet\". My daughters grilled cheese was what you would expect but showed up on a plate with not 1 but 2 chipped corners.\nMr unnamed asked if we would like more fries, we declined. Done with my meal waiting for my daughter to finish up I get a refill of my root beer that i didn't ask for. Mr. Unnamed asks if we will be having dessert to which i decline. My daughter asks for a to go cup for the rest of her drink. We end up with a to go cup full of fresh drink. Thanks but that isn't what we asked for. If this is corporate policy ignore it or change it. it is wasteful and doesn't send the correct message to kids.\nMr unnamed then tells me I can settle up via the tablet thingy blasting messages at me the entire time we are eating. I intend on paying cash. You get the picture and I am out of room.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8864621dbf8de225:0xdcd4b6f3607c88b8"}

This location was a good middle-ground meeting place, so we knew RR would be perfect. There were many other dining choices in the area. Unfortunately, they ran out of gluten free buns. While that was disappointing, the entire meal was mishandled. The manager came over (only after we asked for him, as he sent the server to tell us) and apologised, but with that \"not my problem\" attitude, and we somehow ended up waiting an extended length of time for our meal (where the only real change was sandwiches without buns). When delivered, our fries were cold. The manager said he'd discount the meal and not only was it not discounted, we were still charged extra for gluten free buns that we didn't get. I WASTED a RR reward on the meal (I always put in my rewards number and didn't realize we were due a free burger). Also, when a RR in a high traffic area is not busy at noon, that should be a warning sign! Due to the long time in getting our meal, we didn't have the time to try to settle our issues and seriously doubt the management cared one way or the other, since he did not come back to check on the end result.

I've got the butterscotch shake on my list for the next time my waistline can handle it.\nThere are several sizes of burgers but even the smaller junior burger i prefer is still pretty large and it will be juicey with a nice fried greasy taste and usually done medium. Comes with the standard onion, tomato, and iceberg lettuce leaf trifecta. I would not call it a playful little pickle but those are usually there too.\nI actually prefer the fried chicken sandwich. If anyone is old enough to remember the Chuck-wagon that Dairy Queen used to carry in the 90's its very similar to that. A huge chunk of fried chicken on a buttery toasted bun with all the hamburger toppings. I'd recommend holding the cheese (they usually have provolone if you must) and adding extra mayo or if your taking it home try some thousand island dressing on it.\nOn the down side the location can be cramped to manuever your car into as its a small lot and drive through only and service can get pretty slow. Its a small shop for sure usually just one or two people working really hard inside. They will come out to your car to speed things up if its not raining out. I also flatly did not like the fried mushrooms here. Button mushrooms in a sphere of rather plain batter that explodes into a watery juice, it was just was not my thing.\nBut seriously try the shakes.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8864680aab132f8d:0xae5341d686970bb9"}

The last several times we've been to Goodlettsville Cracker Barrel they've been out of most of the food we ordered, brought us the wrong food, cooked the food wrong and had lousy service.  Yesterday our server said the cornbread was in the oven but 45 minutes later she said it still wasn't ready.  They were cooking cornbread muffins yet I can bake an entire big skillet of cornbread to golden brown in 22 minutes.  Go figure!  I'm fairly certain that the Hendersonville Cracker Barrel recently gave me food poisoning with their turnip greens.  Needless to say we are done with Hendersonville and Goodlettsville Cracker Barrels.

I ordered the meatloaf with the veg of the day (\"boiled\" cabbage), green beans, and mashed potatoes. My partner got chicken and dumplings. The cabbage was lightly blanched in water at most resulting in it being very underdone with little seasoning if any. The green beans tasted like someone opened a can, dumped it in a 1\/3 pan and set it in a steam well to warm up. Four minutes later, they scooped it on to my plate, lukewarm and fresh from a can with no effort to make it palatable. My mashed potatoes had chunks of potato that were undoubtedly underdone as if someone stretched out the batch with par-cooked diced potatoes and sold it. The meatloaf was good. The biscuits came out burned well after the food hit the table. The food was cold, but the biscuits were burned as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp since the order came back. My partner's chicken and dumplings had rubbery, large pieces of chicken in it. She just ended up eating around the chicken. This was not the end of the night when one can expect a limited effort. It was 7:30 PM. Slogging through the meal reminded me of a morning run while hung over from a long night of drinking. You just push through it stone-faced because you know if you just keep pushing, the end will come soon. I've been disappointed by Cracker Barrel before, but never like this. I could have produced better results with a room temperature can of Chef Boyardee and rock to open it with.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8864650cb1aa7b3b:0xfe446cf5e06fb3da"}

When I stepped up the lady turned to the person behind me and addressed them instead. I figured maybe I hadn't been forward enough she didn't think I was ready perhaps? I waited for that customer to be done and addressed her and again she beckoned the customer who had just walked up behind me keep coming forward. Frustrated I figured I would just go grab the order off the shelf since I had paid for it already, but it  was missing some of the things I had asked for.\nI got in line again and waited once I got to the counter the lady went talk to an employee about candy instead of talk to me... I told her I was taking my food but I needed my salad dressing.  She huffed and called into her walkie for kitchen to bring it upfront and said she didn't know if my food was even ready yet. I told her I saw it I just needed my extras. She handed me my bag and walked off but left some of the order on the shelves and walked off before I could even ask her to hand it to me. At that point, I had spent 15 min to get the food I paid for and could see waiting for me since I had walked in... I gave up and went behind the  counter and grabbed the rest my meal. I went to leave and a lady from the kitchen brought the salad dressing and was very polite. The 7ish min it took me get back to my work I figured out not only was all my food freezing cold but I didn't even get my biscuits.

He was feeling well enough several days ago so we took a trip. It is only about 15 minutes from downtown Nashville depending on traffic. I love the little store full of old timey decor, and games, and lovely clothes for women and children. Sorry I didn't notice if they have men's. :\\ We got there around 11:00 a.m. and were seated within 10 minutes. The service was exceptional, and after the first couple bites of our I meal, I believe the exact words I said to my husband were, \"Why do we eat out anywhere else?\" The food really is so good. If you are in Nashville for a long period of time away from home, and you are missing those home cooked meals, this is the place to go. All the vintage decor and dated advertisement posters hanging on the walls are very neat to see as well while enjoying your meal and endless sweet tea refills. It's conveniently located right off the interstate. So worth the stop. :)","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8864650cb1aa7b3b:0xfe446cf5e06fb3da"}

The temp outside was like 50 degrees, and we were set by the corner vent above us, and it was blowing more 50 degrees air on my friend and me. Her nose was cold, I am hot natured and I froze.  I asked to be moved one she brought tea, she said they were unable to, that we could go get in the long line and wait for another call to sit if we like.  I said no, can you turn the air down, she said, no, it is controlled by corporate.  So then 20 minutes later, and we ordered, finally, then 15 minutes later she walked past us without food, and I asked, is our food ready yet.  This is her response to a tee...\"Oh, I don't know, the kitchen has plates lined up across the line ready to go out but we are so busy\"...I said, Well is our food sitting there where it's getting cold?  She said, I don't know.  (That was it, I had my friend get up and leave and I told the young seater girl, this was the worst service ever, and we never got the food we ordered.  p.s. When I told my BFF of this, she said her and her husband were there at lunch and they couldn't eat because the utensils were so very NASTY!!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8864650cb1aa7b3b:0xfe446cf5e06fb3da"}

The service was a good as could possibly be expected. I sat at the bar and my bartender was also the server and busser for the entire place. He worked his tail off. I know times are tough but if you're going to put people in that position please make sure they have high quality product to bring out even if it's a bit cold. The wings may have been good but they were so drowned in a heavy sauce I couldn't even taste the chicken. A saving grace could've been homemade ranch to dip them in but it was thick and clearly store bought. The truffle fries came out covered in an unidentifiable cheese that had gone cold and the classic burger appeared and tasted like pre-made frozen patties, perfectly symmetrical in size and shape and mealy.

I didn't say I wanted a celery juice blend.... it shouldn't be a problem for me to get what I'm paying for. Today is the last day I'll be here. Back to making my juices at home, I can do without the attitude. Didn't even tell me thank me or anything, just handed me my juice and walked away.. very poor customer service.\n\nUpdate: I recieved am email from the Owner Celeste Krenz from the email address for Ryan Cooney. Where I was pretty much accused of acting aggressively and intimidating. And basically informed I needed to take accountability for my precieved behavior. This according to the story she got from the staff which were the furthest thing from the actual truth. Never in my life have \"excuse me ma'am\" \"could you do..\" \"thank you\" \"have a good day\" ever been accused of being aggresive or intimidating. Only makes me wonder it is a race thing but I won't speculate. Now I am even more offended than I was by Katie. Customer service is obviously not a top priority here. So the staff can not greet you, roll their eyes multiple times, etc and it be the customers fault. To make a false accusation to look better is obviously coming from the head down.","resp":{"time":1547130929468,"text":"Hi Kela, I am so sorry to hear about your negative experience at our Downtown store this morning.

They serve a large pizza for 9.99 nothing fancy but I've found it excellent for movie nights to split between a few friends.  They do have some specialty pizzas and subs too if a Pepperoni or Supreme is not your craving. I find the hand tossed crust to be pretty tasty if a little chewy.  The ingredients are average quality but they are generous in loading up their pies. I  also give them an extra star for the great service I've consistently experienced.

When I walked in I ordered from the self service tablets instead of the menu that was against the back and right walls. I like that there were many food and drink options to choose from and the purchasing process wasn't too bad, it asked for my name and number so they could call my name and text me when my food was prepared. The wait was about 8 minutes, maybe 10, but it was expected. I was given a paper straw and I have never used one before so I was excited to try it to see if I'd slurp up any paper, but surprisingly it was durable and never failed to do its job. Also, I liked seeing that they recycle their materials. The burger and shake I prefer were both very good, but for the price they did not fill my hunger like I preferred.\u00a0 The setting was modern and welcoming. The lighting and green really brought the whole place together. I did not see any problem with my experience except for the price.

He said they didn\u2019t even bother giving him an itemized receipt, just a credit card receipt for $19.99. When he got to the hotel and we opened the bag from Shalimar, we were in for a shock!\n\nFirst the vegetable pakora was unlike any vegetable pakora we have seen. It was made the laziest way, absolutely no effort was put in it, as you can see from my pics.\n\nNext the Saag Paneer, which happen to be my husband\u2019s favorite, came in the tiniest takeout container. We paid full price for it, why were we served half the portion! I have posted a side by side pic of the Eggplant in Garlic Sauce that I got from Chinatown a few doors down comparing it to the Saag Paneer we received. Look at the portion difference basically for the same price. My husband said there was zero taste to the Saag Paneer, again cooked with no love or effort.\n\nFinally the Paratha, my husband had called them to ask about their Naan and they had said they do not own a Tandoor and their Naan comes from a facility outside (I.e. frozen Naan) so he wanted to be safe and ordered the paratha. When we touched the foil it came in, it felt hard as a rock. On opening the foil, there was a joke of a portion of paratha that too it was hard as a rock and can you believe they have the audacity to charge $3.99 for this!\n\nShalimar has to be one of the worst food experiences we have ever experienced!

I was happy to see the 100% marks for their health rating, and the festive environment. However, the food was not very appealing. Albeit, my food selections were from 4 vegetarian dishes (saag paneer, okra curry, a mushroom curry, and something else). The spices used for each dish did not produce the mouthwatering flavors known to describe these indian dishes. They all tasted similar and rather bland actually. The vegetable to oil ratio is fairly high as well. The \"naan\" might be pita bread-whatever it is, I think it is not great. The saving point was the tandori roti - which was fresh and delicious. If you eat here, i would steer you away from their fake naan. There are a handful of indian restaurants in the area I have visited- Sitar, bombay palace, and woodlands (in no order of preference).

That being said, this place is far and above the best of them. There was nothing about any of our meals that could be complained about, and my picky taste buds tried them all.\n\nI had the Nashville Hot Chicken Burger, which you can rest assured has no beef. Now, don't get angry with me, but this was my first experience with Nashville hot chicken (I get heartburn). Let me tell you that it was some of the most tender chicken I have ever tasted, and the pickles and coleslaw complement it perfectly. I would have this again next time, if I wasn't set in my way of trying something new every time.\n\nNow my wife and son are a bit pickier than I am, so they both had the grilled cheese, my wife's with added turkey. The three cheeses mixed for the perfect flavor combination, and while I am typically a puritan when it comes to grilled cheeses, the juicy turkey mixed perfectly to create a flavor that might even rival the original.\n\nYou better believe that I will come back as often as I can.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x886465934e76a09f:0xeede76dae1ec2c5"}

I met a few friends there and had obviously never been before. When it was my turn in line, I told the barista that I mostly drink my coffee black- his response was,  \"That's cool. Let me know when you're ready. Next!\" Like...no attempt at suggesting anything, didn't even offer drip coffee (which they apparently offer, along with regular hot tea, but neither is on the menu). I should also point out that it was NOT busy, so the expectation of assistance was not unreasonable. Overall, I got a very rude and snobby vibe the, and will be unlikely to return.","resp":{"time":1523743399275,"text":"Alicia Beth, thank you for your feedback.

This location is conveniently located and well appointed with plenty of tables to sit and enjoy your purchase at. I am knocking off one star because service is incredibly slow, it should not take 20 minutes to make 2 salads when there was only one person ahead of us. Up your service time and I'm sure that this location will thrive.","resp":{"time":1524165705377,"text":"Victoria, thank you so much for taking the time to share your thoughts! We're thrilled to hear that you are excited about our newest location. Our goal is to provide healthy food--- conveniently. Part of that, of course, is speed. We're sorry that we didn't live up to our own high expectations in that area. We are going to reevaluate our process for Urban Bowl salads in order to help speed up their delivery. While chopping and preparing lots of fresh ingredients does take time, we agree that 20 minutes is much too long. Again, thank you for sharing this feedback. We are taking immediate action to help make The Urban Juicer as convenient as possible!"},"gmap_id":"0x8864669f3f535aad:0x290f1c0c5fd6383a"}

I got a burger and should have asked for no pickle because I scraped half of my cheese of while removing the pickles, but it still tasted amazing. We also ordered chicharones. I\u2019ve honestly never ordered any from a restaurant. I\u2019ve only had them from a Jimenez grocery store. The Jimenez ones are small, crunchy, and addictive. These are bigger and more fluffy like pork rinds, but they were good! The service was excellent, and I love how you place a card on the table when you want to order or get a refill.\n\nThe reason for four stars is the place is tiny, and they\u2019re making super greasy food literally beside the bar. My husband and I walked into a literal cloud of smoke. It\u2019s like frying burgers or something in your kitchen, having to open the windows and turn on the fan to keep the alarms from going off, then returning to your kitchen five hours later and wondering if the strong burger smell will ever go away. I\u2019ve been to a few bars with similar concepts (namely Bar on Buena in Chicago), and I don\u2019t remember walking into a cloudy smoke-filled bar. I\u2019m not sure what the difference is (maybe that MC specializes in burgers), but this won\u2019t keep me from not returning.

A great sauce, and the mushrooms and cheese went perfectly along with it. The pinsa (pizza) had a sauce that wasn't too chunky or sweet, and the basil and mozzarella were delicious.\n\nA great date spot, we'll definitely be returning. I don't even like soda and still had to try a few of their craft sodas. The orange hibiscus was super good. I already know I'll be trying the gnocchi next time I come by.","resp":{"time":1602018773393,"text":"Thanks for all the support, Dustin -- we love serving this Nashville community.

It's a lot of Spanish singing and I felt the need to ask if English was ok lol just not welcoming at all, dismissive actually and I'm cultured. I was so excited to go but don't think I'm ever going again. It's probably better if you go with a group and make your own party out of it. I got to hear my fav song at the end at least.

They brought out another steak after a few minutes, but the 2nd steak was cooked medium-well. I think the cook was just having an off day ... I hope.

The way the cook handles cutting the meat and the other person dressing up the bread with salad and sauces you can tell they have a lot of experience in doing this.

Allergies weren\u2019t taken seriously and now my friend is home with anaphylaxis\n3. We found hair in our sushi\nNow to get started. The server  haylee was awful. We had two people in our party that had allergies to gluten -one with an intolerance and one that has an anaphylactic reaction. The first issue we actually came across was that haylee didn\u2019t I.D. two of us for the wine we ordered, and then when our guests asked about the gluten free options she was very snippy about it. We specifically told her that there were allergies and I even said \u201cwe don\u2019t want any deaths today,\u201d and she went \u201cyeah,ok.\u201d And rolled her eyes. Our gluten free guests ordered and asked for salad, when it came out my friend asked what the dressing was and Haylee snapped \u201cginger\u201d and nothing else. My friend took a few bites and felt off so we went to ask haylee what the ingredients of the ginger sauce was and she was on the phone and assumed we were looking for the restroom and harshly pointed to the restroom. We told her no, we need you. And she was like \u201coh, ok. Give me a minute.\u201d We asked her about the dressing and she was still acting as if it was no big deal and said \u201coh it has a little soy sauce, there\u2019s not much.\u201d Which, if you didn\u2019t know, soy sauce has gluten in it. Now, this is the guest that has an anaphylactic reaction to gluten. She is currently home trying to get her throat to stop swelling. And on top of all of this, we found hair in our food. Overall, I\u2019m angry and disappointed. In total I spent 78$ and left no tip. I don\u2019t know what else to say. This is ridiculous and unacceptable.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8864668cbb7ffabd:0xe7c0cf5e7b19c0ef"}

The owners are incredibly nice and very passionate about what they are doing.\n\nThe Space and Atmosphere:\nAs this is a gaming bar\/hangout, the place is pretty dim, which makes sense and works well with all the TV's. They host regular events on their Facebook page so something exciting is always going on. They do offer beverages, beer, food, and dessert that are all incredibly reasonably priced. You can have a lot of fun here without spending loads of money.\n\nThe Games:\nTheir VR setups are large and they even have multiplayer options. You pay per minute for VR but can play as many different games within your allotted time as you want. I personally recommend Beat Saber! They have great Xbox One, PS4, and PC offerings. You are more than welcome to bring your own consoles\/games if you would like as well.\n\nOverall:\nA true, dedicated gaming bar\/hangout is exactly what Nashville needed and this places fits the bill.

You then add additional meat selections and items that you want to cook on your own personal grill by selecting them from a cold bar. I had the Miso soup, and it was amazing with the soy rolls.

My friend suggested this place and I had high hopes.\n\nThey were packed inside and it was busy, and short staffed (it seemed like). The hostess was also the owner, maybe? But she was clearing off tables and trying her best to control the crowds.\n\nI had no idea that it was a buffet style where people touch tongs like a typical buffet. I thought they'd bring you the food but nope. The plates and bowls were dirty and food stains in\/on them. There was food over the floor in the buffet area. Some sauces were empty.\n\nThe food was good but you put the sauces on the meat yourself so of course you know if it'll be good, am I right? It was mostly all plain meat exp the chicken. We had to constantly ask for rice for the BBQ we were cooking. It was a personal sized bowl and they kept bringing out one small bowl at a time so we had to ask constantly. They didn't give us scissors to cut the meat so we cut the meat with chopsticks.\n\nThe menus were sticky and had food on them. So they were cleaned prior.\n\nLet's all remember COVID-19 is going on. This was a high touch place. If you go, expect to get COVID-19. Nothing was clean.\n\nThe womens bathroom door was broken and the stall door in the womens restaurant was broken too!\n\nI'm sorry but I wouldn't go back.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88646708acd3bcf5:0xbe21712f6c36813c"}

I am a middle Tennessee resident from a Mexican background. Cow tongue? Cow tripe? Chicharrones?...yes please! OK back to Cantina Laredo, don't expect the legit Mexican food found in a Mexican market. It's a restaurant in the southeast after all, it's catered for the North American palette. However, the sauces and spices they use are picked very well. Heck, some of the sauces...I swear they got the recipe from my mother. Anyway, it's a very delicious place to eat, dinner time is usually busy. Crowds are typically well dressed, it's slightly upscale food after all. So I reviewed this (for Google points sure, but) because the Sunday brunch...yeah, it's absolutely worth it! Complimentary bloody \"Maria\" or mimosa with a brunch selection. I even had them make me a different dish by adding and changing out some items. The price is less than some place like cracker barrel, well once you take into account the flavors and quality of the food. Long story short, you must try this place. Funny bonus story, I accidentally pronounced \"limonada\" with my fluent native Spanish speaking tongue and accent twice when eating dinner here one night...the, very VERY Caucasian, waiter felt the need to correct my pronunciation of the word, both times, by pronouncing it as white and southern as fried oreos...t'was jolly fun seeing how serious he was about this. :-D","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8864668a4c3f1061:0x83263003cdd36c0d"}

Unfortunately, back as a Grad student, and the lunch deals are gone. I've only been there once in the last couple years, but the burger I had was less the \"fine dining\" than I remember and more \"fancy big mac.\" The thin, mediocre patties were masked in too much of a house dressing of some kind. It was good, but the kind of good I regret later. Aside from this one food item - I was pleased with my experience. The service was great and I love the big windows and quiet atmosphere.

I have to eat gluten free, and they were very accommodating and brought tamari \"soy\" sauce instead of regular soy sauce. The waiter was very friendly and attentive.\nYes, the prices are higher than if you are eating at a restaurant that is not in a resort. However, the fish was very fresh, the overall size of the rolls were standard, so I expected to pay more.\nI'm not sure how they have such a low score, unless it is mostly based on price comparisons with restaurants that have more thru traffic.

My party of 20 arrived and could not get seating in the bar area so we sat outside and only after learned that the deal would not be applicable to us. Some members of the group ordered the burger anyways and what we received was the same crappy $5 burger but because we were sitting outside, we had to pay $16.25 for it. The burger patty was TINY with one TINY tomato, etc. The logic behind this is ridiculous. At least if we were expected to pay $16 for a burger, then we expected to get a burger that was worth $16! In addition, the service was VERY slow. Orders came out out-of-oder (people who ordered first got their meals last, etc.) and it took ~45 minutes for each order to be served (and it was not even that busy!). Lastly, I personally bussed the table (empty glasses and a checkbook) at the beginning because it was left a mess and was talked to VERY RUDELY by the female manager who treated me like a servant and directed me exactly where to put the bussed items in a very undermining and unappreciative way. This is my second time at Table 3 and the first time was not great either.

The sandwich was absolutely wonderful, although I could hardly finish it all. The service was great, with some classy wine bottles serving the water.

I ate there at prime time at 7:30 on a Friday night.\nI started with their crab bisque which is hard to screw up, but this was more like a bowl of water with a few pieces of crab thrown in and a strage froth on top. No thickness, richness or plentiful crab as our waitress suggested.\nI didn't feel like  a heavy meal so for my entree I was really looking forward to their shrimp cocktail as it was on both the oyster menu (very hard to understand) & their main menu. The shrimp were not cleaned well, but worse, they were wobbly, kind of small, & not a firm, great tasting shrimp at all.\nIronically, the waitress said there would be 5 in the order but 6 arrived. A pleasant surprise, but they tasted and looked like they came from Kroger.\nThe bread (has to be bought) was limited to baguette slices, and not crusty or fresh.\nThe waitress couldn't explain what the Salmon cake was like either. That tasted very mildly smoked and had a strange astringency we couldn't place. My wife took 2 bites only.\nThe best thing of everything the table of 4 had was probably their omelet, which isn't saying much for a Friday evening meal.\nGreat location, ok ambiance, & at best, ok food.\nI really wanted this to be good so we wouldn't have to fight the crowds downtown.

I had the trout, which was a very thin cut of overcooked meat with some saut\u00e9ed haricot verts thrown on top.

The older black lady behind the counter was having what sounded like a personal conversation with the customer in front of me, for an extended amount of time. It seemed like 5 minutes, but in reality may have been 2-3 minutes; it seems like forever as I\u2019m standing there, only one other customer as I walked up, and I stare blankly ahead for a few minutes while they have a conversation about their families and friends.\n\nSo they finish their conversation and complete the order, the customer in front of me moves over. The lady behind the counter looks up at me, as if she\u2019s waiting for me to initiate the conversation and transaction. I get the hint, and begin ordering. She\u2019s very short with me, and not at all friendly. I finish the order quickly(I\u2019ve had plenty of time to decide while waiting), pay, and I\u2019m off. No smile, no \u201cthank you\u201d, \u201chave a nice day\u201d... nothing.\n\nEmployees like this make your customers feel very unimportant. Customers don\u2019t see the owners, who are relying on each customer to pay the bills.

The amount of meat on my cheese steak was substantially less than I normally get at Charleys locations in my hometown of Columbus, OH, plus what food I did get was a good bit more bland than normal.

It was a second spot we visited after the first spot we visited was closing at 11 pm and this place was open until 2 am on Saturday. It was a very quaint establishment. We only had drinks as the kitchen was closed that late at night. I had the ginger beer and I guess I didn\u2019t realize fresh ginger was that spicy. It wasn\u2019t hot but had a warm after taste as it went down and was pretty good. From what I gather on the other drinks ordered they were heavy handed on the pour and that can be good or bad depending on your liking. Being mostly fancy drinks, the prices were a typical $12 to $15 each. Nice atmosphere and pretty good music being played on sound system.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x886467554d1756a5:0x5d3de0ea0de4f9cf"}

Makes no sense. I eventually had to leave to get back to work with no food like many other customers did as well. This location has never had its act together so I almost feel bad they had to try this new system. I like the idea of the digital only concept but I feel like corporate sprung this upon the stores with absolutely no thought or research of how to implement it - except to just do it. Chipotle already reached out and gave me a free entree but what\u2019s the point if I can\u2019t trust when to pick it up and potentially risk having to skip lunch. Not ok for a location where tons of people go on their lunch breaks. We need to be able to trust that the pickup time is accurate.","resp":{"time":1620749091535,"text":"This is not the impression we want to leave, Will.

Their menu was easy to navigate in the fact that it was completely folded with options, which I find appealing. We ate the club sandwich and the pimento cheese, both of which were an easy 10\/10. I usually go for a reuben, but they were out of corned beef. Also, the wait staff is friendly, inviting and knowledgeable about their menu. Our waiter, Brandon, was quick and efficient and helped guide us to what our meal should be. Overall, I'd say the restaurant is worth a try, I will definitely be revisiting in the future.","resp":{"time":1620667876601,"text":"Hi Houston! Your kind comments are truly appreciated.

The coffee was good.  The drinks were good but the service and cleanliness were absolutely horrible.  Plus, for what it was, it was expensive.\n\nIt took almost ten minutes for someone to come get our drink order.  It took another 5-7 to get our drinks.  We ordered our food and it took over a half an hour to arrive.  We had to ask the server about it after several tables seated after us were given their food.\n\nOur coffee, water and mimosas sat empty for 15 minutes before a server returned.  The manager ran the food and when we asked her for more coffee she said sure and then never came back.  A manager or server never checked on us after our food was delivered by a food runner and there was no apology for the 30 minutes we waited on food.\n\nTo top it off, both restrooms were absolutely disgusting.  Without going into detail- it was clear that they had not been cleaned or checked on for days.  They didn\u2019t even have soap!","resp":{"time":1618852758416,"text":"Hi Lissa, please accept my sincere apologies.

The place supposedly has Brooklyn, NY origins, yet they made the amateurish mistake of slicing brisket in the wrong direction, causing your corned beef or pastrami sandwich to be \"meat crumbles\" instead of meat slices which, while tasting good, gave the sandwich an unusual texture that detracted from the authentic deli sandwich vibe. We pointed this out to the very cordial Manager who stopped at our table to inquire about our satisfaction and she was very appreciative of our suggestion. Went back again several days later....they were still serving \"meat crumble\" sandwiches. Oh well.\n\n\"Fool me once, shame on you.

Pastrami is my favorite and that\u2019s what our server said was the best, so that\u2019s what I got! The flavor was nice. Super simple, just bread and pastrami.\n\nMy one major complaint however, is that I ordered the jumbo sandwich, which is twice the price of the standard. Upon arrival to my table, I looked around and realized that my sandwich was not noticably larger than everybody else\u2019s (as our server told me that he had yet to sell a jumbo sandwich). I think that we were either given the standard size sandwich, or we were entirely ripped off. In the kindest of respects, there\u2019s no way that that sandwich was worth anywhere close to $25 (with no side). It was the most expensive thing on the menu, and I honestly feel it was a $15 sandwich (with a side), even at a nice lunch spot in Nashville. I\u2019m curious to try the lesser expensive things that they have there. I would just steer clear of \u201cjumbo.\u201d\n\nThank you, Shep.","resp":{"time":1618498247677,"text":"Hi Brian, it is so nice to hear that you enjoyed warm hospitality while you were with us!

We had latkes and they were a bit overdone on the outside.\nThe corned beef breakfast sandwich I had was pretty good.\n\nThe thing that was insulting was the bagel with cream cheese.\nWe asked if we could get a side of onions and cucumbers to go with that, what we didn't realize was that $4.75 bagel would get an extra $4 surcharge, making it a $9 bagel. No lox or anything like that.\n\nThe food was fine, execution in some regards missed the mark, but with what their price points are you'd expect fantastic execution and quality.","resp":{"time":1620667188567,"text":"Hi Christopher, thank you for being our guest, and for sharing your honest insights regarding your recent experience.

{"user_id":1.021430779e+20,"name":"Shalin Shah","rating":2,"text":"It's clear that the Shep's management has decided that the opportunity to nickel and dime is more important than serving complete and cohesive dishes.\n\nGlancing at the Shep's menu, one is offered 15 different options to add items to their meal - after prices already significantly higher than local delis. That isn't always a problem; I don't mind paying for quality. Is it too much to expect a complete meal though?\n\nI get it - it's 2021 - expecting a side with a sandwich is so Panera. But is lettuce and tomato the next victim of our race to be anti-Panera? Is mustard?\n\nI had the regular pastrami - $13.25.  For this, you get a generous serving of meat, two pieces of bread and a pickle. Truly exceptional house-made meat, no complaints. However, being asked to pay for lettuce and tomato on the side when the sandwich so clearly needs the brightness, crunch and acidity feels insulting. I understand the original does not have \"L+T\"  - but spicy mustard is part of the original and I must have missed the option to add it to my sandwich for a nominal charge.\n\nIt's not too much to expect a dish as classic as a pastrami sandwich to be similar across the country. While I can appreciate the business decision to offer a sandwich in the model that Shep's has decided upon, I will instead be thinking of the pastrami sandwich at Langer's (from the Chef's home town of Los Angeles) - where the aforementioned establishment serves it's pastrami with a complete set of flavors without surchage in the shadow of two James Beard Foundation awards.","resp":{"time":1622129517144,"text":"Hi Shalin, thank you for joining us at Shep's Deli.

I've had 3 different bowls. Chai Mystique is my hands down favorite! The Apple Pie a la Mode is pretty good too.

And boy am I glad he did. This was my first visit to this place and by far it was a great choice.\nTake a minute to Google the location and review their menu to get an idea of what it is. It's a parfait bar and they use fresh fruit and natural ingredients for EVERYTHING. It's all blended together and topped with granola, honey, and whatever other toppings that you request.\nNot a particularly good place for large groups because of seating but STILL good for in and out. I believe there is more seating outside. For you health nuts, it's a delectably dessert-like sweet treat. And the portions are pretty sizeable for the price (average $8 for a bowl of fruity goodness).\n\nMy first-time favorite is the Peanut Butter & Jelly Bowl!!!\n\nUntil next time....

The marinara sauce is so good I could eat it like a soup. Meatballs and bruschetta are amazing. I am always torn between wanting to constantly promote their business and also wanting to keep them my little secret because this place really is the best kept secret in Nashville. I love the BYOB aspect, too. There\u2019s a liquor store conveniently located in the plaza next door, so we always grab a bottle of wine before heading over.
