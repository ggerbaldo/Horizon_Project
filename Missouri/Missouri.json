I had the barbecue chicken in a cone. The pieces were a decent size and adequately coated with barbecue sauce. It was not spicy - which was fine for me. They offer other sauces with more kick! I liked nibbling on the cone. I had corn for my side. Although it\u2019s called Caj\u2019n corn on the menu, I didn\u2019t taste a lot of kick.\n\nThey have ample dining spots inside and outside. I also like the bright colors of the decor.\n\nAlthough many can enjoy this restaurant, I think this fast food restaurant will be nice for families visiting the medical complex. It\u2019s a short walk from the medical complex and the service is fast enough that they can return without delay.

The restaurant is clean and has a simple decor. It has an easy touchscreen order screen. The chicken is tasty but the bbq is salty and fries is small and expensive.

{"user_id":1.05009019e+20,"name":"Ashley Martin","rating":3,"text":"With over 400k views and comments in the Facebook group Date Night Stl I was very eager to try this restaurant. Me and a friend decided to visit the restaurant during opening weekend as expected there was a slight wait. We both ordered Chickn Cones, fries, cajun corn and mac cheese.\n\nHonestly the sides were completely covered in cajun seasoning. I believe it's their \"thing\" but it was OK. Since it was our first time we wanted to try a little bit of everything. I brought my 1yr old daughter and the cajun seasoning was too much for her to enjoy.\n\nNow the ChicknCone unfortunately after waiting 30 mins to order and about 20 mins to receive food it was ice cold. However, the sauce on the chicken was good. I ordered the hottest flavor \"Peri, Peri\" . It actually wasn't that hot but it was ok.\n\nWe did figure out after sitting outside on the patio and overhearing another customer complain about the cold food that if you order sauceless chicken it comes hot and you can just pour your own. Overall for me 3\/5. I might try again in a few months after they have been established for a while\n\nAnother thing Central West End requires paid parking throughout the week! Don\u2019t forget to pay that because those 10$ tickets are no joke!","resp":{"time":1625609254514,"text":"Hi Ashley, Thank you for visiting, I'm sorry your experience wasn't up to par.

We know where we'll be going for our next anniversary and, since they're so reasonable, for quite a few meals in between.\n\nWe were fortunate to be able to get Lily each time, as she brings both a depth of knowledge of and a passion for food that elevates the experience. Knowing when to stay and chat knowledgeably about the food, the bread, the drinks, the music and when to silently and swiftly serve and not interrupt the flow of our conversation, she IS what every restaurant worker should strive for. When you go, do ask for her. Just not on the nights we go ;-)\n\nOur first time we kept it fairly simple with spaghetti and meatballs. If you can call the homemade spaghetti that twists and curls and so perfectly cooked you realize this is what pasta is supposed to be simple. Oh, and that meatball? Softball sized. And falls apart on the tongue. All in a sauce that is so good you are thrilled the best bread in the universe is there so you can mop it up. So, yeah, simple.\n\nOur second meal we went with the amazing 6 course tasting menu (DO get it, you'll be delighted!) and as we gushed to the chef afterwards when he came to chat, it was all wonderful. When he asked us what we didn't like, we could not think of a thing. The tastes in each dish surprise, delight and thank heavens for that divine bread to sop up every drop of sauce. We were lucky that they sent out a little surprise bitters drink to clear the palate, such a delight, and not one but two divine extras.\n\nThere's no doubt that Randolfi's is putting out spectacular food right now. They care deeply about how it is sourced. And served. If you love crazy good food, you've found your place.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87df3552410357e3:0x4df1ac97d4cec68b"}

When you order things you typically don't eat or like and find yourself a raving fan afterwards...that is the sign of a great chef.\n\nWe had dinner for two on the patio. Our server was excellent and kept things flowing without hovering over us and provided excellent recommendations when asked.\n\nWe started with the Buttonwood Farm turkey leg nachos and house smoked trout cake as appetizers and were impressed. I am not a huge fan of dark meat or sweet potato chips but this completely won me over as the flavor, balance, and presentation were all spot on. I envisioning ordering this again on my next visit. Similarly, the trout cakes were superb with a nice spice that paid compliments to the cake.\n\nFor drinks, my dining companion ordered the Macklind Mule which was a balanced, refreshing drink that was truly enjoyable. I had Thomas Goss Cabernet that went well with the meal and something I would order again.\n\nOur entrees consisted of:\n1) Circle B Farm heritage breed \"Berkshire\" pork chop*\ncrispy lemon & Goatsbeard Farm goat cheese polenta cake *\ngrilled Double Star Farms summer squash & bell peppers *\nbasil cream * Scharf Farm smoked peach butter\n\nEverything on this entree was prepared to perfection and full of flavor. I sampled the chop and found it to be one of the most tender and moist meats I had ever eaten. Congratulations to the owners and chef for purchasing quality products and preparing them in a manner that truly embraces the essences of what Grapeseed is all about. I tip my hat to the chef for this meal.\n\n2) Stuffed bell pepper w\/ Buttonwood Farm smoked chicken * local zucchini\nsummer yellow squash * Ozark Forest wild mushrooms * onion * roasted garlic\nThies Farm heirloom tomato sauce * bed of wild rice * lemon-feta vinaigrette\n\nThis was my entree and I don't care for stuffed peppers but I thought I would be adventurous and give it a try and I am glad I did. I fell in love with this meal from the first bite and was loath to share it with my dinner companion as I wanted to eat every morsel. Well prepared, bursting with flavor and filling without being stuffed (me, not the pepper). Every ingredient was fresh, well-made, and went well as a combination.\n\nWe both agreed that on next return we would likely swap entrees as we both loved everything we tasted.\n\nDessert was a bread pudding that would rival the best desserts in St. Louis. Full of flavor and make lite enough, for a bread pudding, that it didn't leave you feeling overfed. I had a berry dessert with some sort of sorbet that was passable and was the only thing I regretted. However the bread pudding was sufficient for the two of us and we make quick picking of it.\n\nOur experience was wonderful from seating, services, and dining. Grapeseed delivered at every spectrum of our expectations and we look forward to returning.\n\nDinner for two including a generous tip was $154\n\nI will return to the restaurant and highly recommend it to others.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b5eb93464eb5:0x5d17e5d64d5480cd"}

I mean you're in the middle of the restaurant man. Real classy! We got our food and it looked good. The crab cakes were good but when I got my entree it was bland and overly spicy. I love spicy food but that was awful. I took 2 bites and ate the French bread the girl gave us. She asked how our food was and we said great which my buddy did think his was actually great. He had the the red beans and rice. We never complain about the food when we are out. The whole experience is to try something new and we did. But we will definitely not be back! Not just on the food alone but the not so great service had a play in it and definitely with the owner sticking his hands down his pants.

The busser cleared our dishes, refilled the water. As a matter of fact, we saw him more than the waiter. So I tipped him. Hopefully management will have a little talk about customer service. You always check on the diners within 2 minutes of delivering their meals. You come back every now and then to make sure they do not need a refill on the their beverage or need napkins. You NEVER drop the bill off while customers are still eating. This is why you get a 10% tip (if you are lucky).","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b54bede11d05:0x11b7891796e58a61"}

Our drink order was taken and our food order was taken and then we became transparent. No visit by our waitress Jamie (names have not been changed to identify the guilty) until she came by to deliver the check. No asking it we needed anything, no asking for refills - and not because she wasn't there as she chatted with every table around us. The only service we received was from the runner who brought our food, who I sincerely hope got part of the tip as she really deserved it all.\nThe music level got progressively louder (I've been in clubs quieter) so that everyone everyone had to shout over it.

She put green peppers and spinach with sweet onion sauce that wasn't even asked for. I spent $21.37 on two sandwiches and two drinks and one of the sandwiches wasn't even made correctly. Called the owner, no answer. Got a call back from the manager and explained what happened. She told me shed contact the store and then call me back. Never received a call back.

The flatbreads mixed sweet and savory and were a nice surprise. Maybe I'm just a restaurant virgin.\n\nScallops were great. The salmon gravlax or whatever it's called was delicious too. They're doing something right with the seafood. All tasted fresh.\n\nThe best thing about this place were the non-alcoholic drink options.  Yeah, that's right. You too can be a part-time alcoholic. I didn't test the bathrooms, but the ambiance was very good. Lowered lights and an atmosphere suitable for conversations.\n\nLadies, take your husband here to show him that you're not a completely worthless piece of slime.

Each with a varying degree of spice\/heat.  My face was the Buffalofu taco. ( Can be gotten.in burrito form as well.) The vegan \"meat'' was flavorful and deceptive. It was prepared in such a way that the texture was amazingly similar to it's carnivore counterpart.  I'm not a food critic by any means; I just know what I like.

The hot and sour soup was amazing. Thick, fragrant broth, perfectly balanced, teeming with a medly of ingredients. The chicken noodle soup was perfection, tender noodles swimming in a broth so delicious I have started on a quest to recreate it (fingers crossed). The spicy cabbage was a simple dish, dressed in a sweet +savory + sour dressing and is VERY HOT. I could only take a few bites at a time.

The crab Rangoon is soooooo good and super stuffed. They give u a whole bowl of sweet and sour sauce for 1 order. The main reason it's not 5 stars is cause they charged tax on every item. So 11.95 for 1 plate turned into 12.50 and there's nothing on the menu that Said they do that.

As I was writing this review, I kept getting distracted by the fantastic music. I realized 2 things:\n\n1. I hadn't noticed the music when I was concentrating on my important notes - it's the perfect level for dining out with a friend or a working lunch alone. It's there, but unobtrusive.\n\n2. It's well curated. This music is new and just the right tone for a chill cafe.\n\nSo they get an extra star for crafting the perfect ambiance. :)","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87df4aab0c7123c5:0xb6a1d7ac8586cae1"}

The spice level in this tasted good, but could be improved for a chronic spicy-food user. I\u2019m sure you can add extra spice per request. However, I do think they try to put too much stuff into this pot, and would opt for the chicken pot next time.\n\nWe ordered fried whole fish. This is a traditional Chinese dish and it is properly prepared. The fish feels a bit small for four people, but given we are in in-land St Louis, it was alright. The accompanying vegetables are done well.\n\nGood to try, doesn\u2019t have too many characteristically regional food to draw me back, but if I ended up craving Chinese food I can definitely come back.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87df35ab4a48727b:0xe3f86cf8091d6f34"}

It sounds like that has been a problem in the past, but not anymore! Surprisingly, they even sat me at a four-top with a view!! Since I was scheduled for 10a, right when they open, it wasn't overly busy or crowded and I didn't have to wait long for anything I ordered off the menu or wait in a line at the buffet.\n\nEverything I tried was quite nice. Even the potatoes that were slightly under seasoned were cooked to the perfect texture, so I found myself eating them anyway! Their breakfast sausage is very mild, but still had flavor. And the bacon is decently thick and not overly cooked.\n\nI decided to order the waffle off the menu, even though I was already filling up on other things and was slightly worried that it would be too much. But they serve mini waffles here, which I think is great! You're given a choice between Maple Syrup or Strawberry Syrup. I opted for the Maple, but then topped it with some strawberries from the buffet! It was a very simple waffle, but nicely done.\n\nThe pasta offered was some sort of cheese stuffed ravioli with a creamy tomato sauce. I thought it was delicious and quite a treat!\n\nThe gentleman working the omelet bar did a fantastic job! I asked for bacon and double cheese. And boy was it cheesey!! Exactly what I was craving!!\n\nBut I have to say that the most impressive part of my meal was the bread pudding! I'd read that the serving was small, but I disagree! This was probably 1.5 in thick and 4 in square! It looked and tasted to be made from croissant dough, which I think is perfectly divine!! The top only had a slight crisp, and the rest was creamy and moist without being overly liquidy.

The problem was when I tried to call the store to communicate the mistake I could not get anyone to answer the phone. I have gotten food here a few times since then with any consistent food quality. At this point the customer service is non existent and this location may as well go out of business. I live in the South St Louis area and wish there was another location available for me to order from. This location gives Wingstop corporate a very bad look....

The meat was dry and bland, there was no cheese on the tacos at all, there was huge chunks of fresh horse radish which I've never seen or had before, and the salsa did even taste as such.

They just need to pay a little more mind to the sides & make sure everything is thoroughly heated. As a California native. This is thee most authentic Mexican restaurant I've found since making the Mid West my home going on 5 years ago. The tacos are DELICIOUS! The carne asada is always well seasoned, succulent & truly cooked to perfection. I myself also love their shredded chicken. Especially on a crunchy shell. Which best of all is fried to order. Their 3 varieties of salsa are quite intoxicating. If your not careful you can easily get full snacking on the chips & salsa, lol. What I like more than their food though is MOST of their staff. Mari & Flaco are always beyond friendly! Flaco in my opinion is their best cook & Mari is the waitress you want to request to be served by. They both always have a smile on their face, are genuinely dedicated to you enjoying your experience & are extremely attentive.\nFrom preparing your order correctly, ensuring you always have something to drink & guaranteeing you want for nothing.

If, on the other hand, you're in the market for amazing authentic Mexican food on the cheap, you need look no further. I have to admit, I haven't explored the menu much yet beyond the tacos, because they are *so* good. I've tried steak, chicken, shrimp and chorizo so far, and I honestly can't pick a favorite. They're loaded with high-quality meat and veggies that are literally fresh-cut; I don't even like radishes (I think that's what the round red things are), and I would never think to put them on a taco, but I make an exception for theirs because it all just works perfectly together. Sure, they cost more than twice what you'll pay in a drive-through, but even so they're only $1.99 apiece and three of them (along with a couple baskets of chips with salsa and OMG-the-queso-is-sooo-good, and of course the traditional giant margarita) is enough to leave me stuffed for the night. My girlfriend got beef enchiladas, and the couple of bites she let me steal convinced me that I need to expand my horizons next time I go... although that's going to mean I need to eat there more often so that I'm not craving their tacos by the time I walk through the door. So yeah, bag the drive-through and skip the fake Mexican place in the strip-mall, drive down to Cherokee Street for some food that's more authentic, less unhealthy and just all-around better.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b473c0ebfa19:0xf510c6e81d60b6b5"}

This location has a drive through so you can order without leaving your car. There's ample parking in the shared lot. What can I not say about Smoothie King...I'm in love with this place. I used to frequent another location so much that they knew me on a first name basis. Smoothie King has all types of smoothies from vegan to an actual dessert type smoothie. You can have spinach,  kale,  fruit,  protein and even ice cream added to your smoothie.  This is the healthiest place I know of to get a smoothie. They have meal replacement smoothies that will fill you up. I try to go on Fridays as much as possible because the medium smoothies are $5 (or $6 for meal replacement smoothies) all day long. The Staff were friendly and very helpful. I don't care what time of the year it is, smoothies are great anytime for me.

They will let you sit there for 5-10 minutes thinking they are open. I see now that the store changed their closing time, but this was not updated on Google, Facebook, or the business door!! What the heck? How hard is it to hand write a note with the updated hours? The hours should have been updated\/posted on the SAME day the change went into affect, not a month later. Lazy, rude, unprofessional!\n\nUpdate in response to management: My review is not for a recent visit - it is for past visits when the posted hours on the door and Google said 10pm, but between 9-10pm the drive through and front doors were closed. This happened to me on at least 3 visits. I thought the closing time was 10pm because that's what was posted EVERYWHERE. I don't understand why employees couldn't communicate this to customers waiting in the drive though after 9pm? I haven't been back after 3 attempted visits and not evening knowing if you were open for business or not. You say no one came after 9pm, but I did and so did other people in the reviews... Why wasn't a note posted on the door when you changed your hours? This is poor management and poor customer service. I've taken my business to another location. Thanks","resp":{"time":1579632667741,"text":"Hi Laura - sorry for your inconvenience.  Upon first opening we tried 10PM but nobody came in that late so months ago we changed to 9PM closing.  Since then all hours on the door, Facebook, Google, Yelp are all updated to show 9PM as our closing time.  I'm not sure where you saw 10PM as all accounts have been updated.

Everytime I stop inside the store it takes forever for anyone to acknowledge me and once someone does ask \"what do you want?\" It seems like no one wants to make the drink. I always get the same drink, 32oz strawberry-The Hulk, no matter what location I go to but this store seems to never make it right or simply hand me the wrong drink everytime. Well, today I decided to try the drive thru out. If you're familiar with this location you can see directly into the store while you're ordering. When I placed my order I could see three people inside throw there hands in the air and run to the back 'office' which made the gentleman taking my order make my drink I guess. Anyways, I get my drink and it has no strawberries in it at all.\n\nSoooooo, yes, today will be my last time going to this location. Although it is much closer to my house I'd rather be a patron at one of the other locations than have to deal with this mess.\n\nMsg to the owner: hire and train your staff on how to treat customers and how to prepare drinks.

One minute you're watching The Great British Baking Show and they're making homemade filo dough; The next, you're on your way to get some delicious Greek food.\n\nWe brought along our irritable child. He was a mess. He was screaming. He was inconsolable. Normally, this isn't important to the review, but in this case it is.\n\nOur server (Yevgeniya), went absolutely above and beyond to accommodate us and help us calm our son down.

I love their buffalo chicken sandwich but I swear they literally put half a chicken on it, and they dont heavily bread it either so you're getting mostly meat.

They have 30+ beers on tap & the outdoor space is more relaxed than other bars in the area, which is a nice touch when you want to have a conversation with friends.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b566f6e44485:0xa20444a0bbb3fdf1"}

A fair price, especially compared to portions and overall service.  Out of about a dozen visits they have served us about 6 five star visits,  4 four star visits, 2 three star visits and one 2 star dud (actually our last visit).  My advice is to eat there during the busier times as you will actually see more attention from the employees than when things are settling down late.  The food seems fresher, the employees, though harried, are WAY more attentive to your drink refills and service is just better.  During the last hour before closing time, service is pathetic.  Everyone is catching up from the busy time and have no time to wait on you.  Food takes longer to get to you, drinks go unfilled while the staff prepares for the next day and the food is just not as tasty.   Seamus' is a great place to eat, but, as we have learned, avoid the last hour of the day to get a truly good experience.  If you aren't totally health conscious, try the fried cheese!  Best cheese that I've eaten.  They have two types that are both delicious.  Even on our worst visit, the cheese was still great.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b566f6e44485:0xa20444a0bbb3fdf1"}

Not to sweet, not too tart... not weak at all. After these 2, I felt amazing! Carne Asada Fries, these have my stamp of approval. My friend and I shared a 1\/2 order as an appetizer and literally we contemplated getting a 2nd order as our meal. What was great was the thickness of the fries that held up the toppings properly, flavor of the steak and ample toppings.  Alas, we did order other food. My order, Chicken Quesadilla. Flavors on point here. I was full, so took the remaining 3 of 4 slices home for later. Chorizo Queso for the table, best tasting chorizo I've had. The flavors were strong, but not overwhelming.  I enjoyed the brightness of the space and service was very friendly and attentive. Certainly looking forward to future visits.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8cbd64aec43d3:0xefeeb539e4a03bdc"}

We were quick to be greeted by the host and then by the bartender, and ordered two margaritas (original and jalepe\u00f1o) and two entrees (stacked tostada and lasagna loca). The original Marg and lasagna were solid but the jalepe\u00f1o and toslastada were very flavorful, I would (and likely will) definitely order them again. We finished the meal with flan which was a good balance between light\/airy and caramel-sweet. The complimentary chips and salsa were great (there a little spice on the chips and the salsa was not too spicy). It's not THE most authentic mexican I've had (which, to be honest, is hard to find in st louis and they don't claim to be either) but the freshness and flavor impressed me. The staff were all friendly and efficient and the ambience casual but clean. Overall, we'll be coming back and I can see Sunny's staying in the neighborhood.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8cbd64aec43d3:0xefeeb539e4a03bdc"}

I am impressed  they are taking my concerns seriously.  They deserve 2 more stars and I will be back you give them a second chance.\n\nSo I visit this bar almost every Tuesday since they brought in dj Rusty. My husband and I are good friends with him and his wife.  He's an awesome dj. But my last visit left me wondering if we'll be back.  They do not advertise that drinks go up in price once karaoke starts.  I get it I've been to plenty of bars that do this but they tell you.  My first drink was $3.50 but my second was $4.50. When I called the bartender out she was shocked then fumbled and said \"oh well I should've charged you $4.00 the first time\". Never once apologized and never told me there was an increase when  karaoke started a friend had to tell me.  I would have understood.  Now you may moot think this is not a lot of money but when my average bill is $45 it adds up.  If I was not paying cash I probably wouldn't have noticed.  But this experience has left me with a feeling of being cheated out of my money.  Drink prices are not the same from bartender to bartender either.  It's sad because we love coming in on Tuesdays but unsure if we will again.","resp":{"time":1522949343332,"text":"Thank you for your feedback.

There was a SNAFU and it didn't arrive on time. The staff handled the problem positively and the dialog was clearly that of one caring friend to another.

Thinking okay....well that's a let down. I proceeded to order the breakfast sandwich. Montezz then refunds me the first order then rings me out again.... I asked for the sandwich to be on ciabatta  bread. Montezz then says \"we don't have ciabatta, we don't have any of the breads on the menu, that menu is wrong\".

The breakfast sandwich was put on hoagie bread and then flattened to the size of a pancake, it was flavorless, and poorly made. The gooey butter cake tasted like bread with frosting on it... Major let down. This is the home of gooey butter cake. I heard the breakfast Lou tasted good. Overall this was the WORST breakfast experience I had of 2017... I'll never come back.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87df3553b2ab3533:0x5c543fbefd6f8ec8"}

Starbucks across the street just reheats frozen pre-made breakfast sandwiches. McArthur's makes their own, so asking for one without bread is easy. I typically order a breakfast sandwich from starbucks, don't eat the bread and lose half the cheese. McArthur's allowed me to order without the bread which was exactly what I wanted. The ham is high quality and delicious, it isn't just a deli ham, it is a real thing sliced ham. Delicious and satisfying. This will be my go to place for breakfast in the loop.

The truffle fries were crispy with wonderful flavor. The chicken katsu was fried to perfection. I think the choice to offer the sandwich on toasted chibatta is a mistake though. Having a sharp fried meat on hard toasted bread makes for a very sharp sandwich which scraped up the roof of my mouth pretty well. Combine that with the size of the sandwich and it's pretty difficult to eat unharmed. That said the flavors there were great as well but I would add more moisture with larger portions of slaw and sauce. Zenwich was great but I think if I were to get the katsu again I'd choose the rice paper wrap instead of the sandwich.","resp":{"time":1621791430279,"text":"Please choose the wrap.

Best brisket ever because it was perfectly juicy and still warm when I got it home.  The outer coating was delicious.  I even liked the taste of the fat that is normal for brisket although I have too much of my own already.  The price is in line with other BBQ places.  Two people picked up phone in orders while I was there.  They ordered one of everything which is why I'm having to go back when they open.  I got two sauces and both were exceptional with great supporting tastes for the brisket.  As I left at 5.45 PM the two workers looked at each other and simultaneously said...so we are completely out.  In fairness they do advertise ... open till 7 unless we run out.  They are the second storefront from the corner of Utah and Rogers.  The phone system asks for your name but say Willie's Backyard BBQ.   The ambience is overwhelmingly smelly.

Regardless so special in many ways. But especially special when ya take care of 4 kids everyday. Unquestionably an amazing lover and mother in every way. And so, this story is about an amazing mother on mother's day who lost her way when she had forgotten about her child whom needed a pizza box for a class project at school the next day. Mom screamed at GOT just a couple hours before, who knows what she saw, have you seen that show before? The show ended shortly, dragons, short men would surely, be a part of next weeks final story. And so she beckoned a request, midnight was near, she needed rest. The morning would bring another day, wild wild west in nearly everyway. As such, the amazing mother, completely had forgotten, a pizza box for her child and she felt nothing short of rotten, and to top it off the child needed blue cottons. Father jumped in his car find a pizza box not far. Mother ran down the steps, and started the wash. Father did what was right, no snoring, late night mission, find an empty pizza box dont keep her wishing.\n\"Look no further QT is in sight.\" A bright red shirt, good posture ya heard, the young man looked like zuck, when I asked for the box he said the What? \"I'm unsure what to charge sir, weve never sold just a box\" - then out of nowhere the young buck said sir come here, he gave me that box. I promised him a dollar, a rave review to his boss, a heartfelt holler, . This young man's bravery saved not just me, it was motherly, brotherly, and quite frankly utterly lovely. Like bro come here hug me. This review proves how quick trip made a customer of me, because its basically customary, for their employees to act tactfully and boldly. Cheers to the kid, young buck, not that old, that was challenged and rose.\nThis kid was so humbling, no whine and not mumbling, whom went out of his way to sell me a pizza box for a dollar and put his job on the line.

Worst of all, though, was while this clown show was going on the manager (Idk his name, bald with glasses) was just hanging out, chating up the chefs and server, not running food, not checking on tables, not running drinks, not disciplining the server, not doing anyhting but looking board and disinterested.\n\nI would recommend avoiding this spot until they get a new manager and some decent staff.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b4a151f6b507:0x3f1ee4245e680952"}

We ate here twice as we had 2 Groupons, and both times it was an utter disappointment. Typically when service is this bad and food this awful, I write the establishment to let them know, but in this case I figured everything was SO bad they had to already have known.\n\nThe first time we ate here, we had the ravioli as one of our appetizers. They were so burnt they were almost black; when my boyfriend simply mentioned this to the waitress she said \"yes, they do look burnt\" and walked away. No offer to replace or even an apology. When ordering, we asked the size of the tenderloin on the menu, and were told it was 10 ounces - for that price it seemed like a great deal, so it was ordered. When it came out, it couldn't have been 6 ounces - this was mentioned to the waitress and she said, \"oh no, that's 10 ounces before it's cooked; it shrinks.\" My burger tasted burnt as well, but I ate it as I was hungry and couldn't imagine her getting it fixed.\n\nWithout going into as much detail, our second experience was horrible as well. My chicken was so dry you couldn't even chew it, and the sauce on it was really terrible.

I then called and asked to speak with the manager, he said his name was Joe and that the owner Jerry would be in Monday 10am. I asked why has he continuously denied service to our house hold. We have always tipped pretty darn good. He then stated that they have us in the computer as do not deliver because we refused an order in the past. I explained to him that the order was rejected because it arrived 45 mins late and it was cold as ice. Even the delivery driver that day agreed and apologized but yet we are being punished because of their mistake. Joe the shift manager couldn't have cared less, it wasn't his problem. Call the owner next week was his response. No understanding or apologies given at all.

The Molokhia was listed as vegan, but then immediately stated it was cooked with chicken or lamb broth... my girlfriend ordered the Moussaka, listed as vegetarian, but was told they made it with beef that day.\n\nThe space occupies what was formerly Athlete Eats, and much of the decor remained the same with some tapestries over the walls to add a bit of middle eastern flair.  We were greeted promptly, but the service slowed WAY down, but I attribute this more to a cultural thing, as every restaurant I visited in Qatar was the same way.\n\nWe had the baba ganouge as a starter, which was extremely tasty, but were only provided a single pita cut into quarters.  For dinner it was the falafel sandwich, and the shawarma sandwich.  We both ordered fries, but only one order was received.  The falafel was supposed to have a tahini sauce, but contained very little at the bottom of the wrap.  When requesting some additional sauce, it took a bit for it to arrive at the table.\n\nI will most certainly be trying them again, but a menu update is needed to actually reflect contents so those with dietary restrictions aren't left to wonder.

We tipped throughout the night in cash and bought some drinks in cash while others were on our tab. When we closed out our tab it was with a bartender that we didn't use for the majority of the night and he saw us put a \"0\" in the \"tip\" field of the ticket since we'd already tipped throughout the night. He started calling names and acted highly innappropriate. We were unable to resolve the issue with him because he refused to listen to us in regard to tipping. We then called after leaving and the manager backed him up without even researching the problem or issue.\n\nI'd highly recommend avoiding this establishment since they can't figure out how to treat their patrons.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b4e969760a91:0xec6c383b9350c11a"}

A romantic ambiance, great fire place and music. The service is always friendly and professional. And the food...delicious! We love the tuna tartar, flatbreads, salads and have almost tried eveeything on the menu. I'm a malbec woman and we had a bottle of Maipe Malbec 2014 Argentine wine. It was delectable. I recommend this to anyone for a first date since the drink menu is well established and there are small plates fire enjoyable food and conversation. Great for a romantic night out or intimate celebration.

{"user_id":1.004522656e+20,"name":"Joshua Katz","rating":3,"text":"Having been to a few other make-your-own pizza places, I figured I needed to give Doughocracy a try.  Honestly, this place just did not match up to the competition, although the pizza was decent.  The first thing I found odd was that at other places like this you pay for all you can eat toppings, not for 2 cheeses and 4 toppings, and the unlimited toppings at the other places is cheaper.  Additionally, you order all your toppings right away and then they go and make the pizza.  At other places they start you of with your crust and you walk down the line of toppings, picking out what looks good and what you want as you see it.\n\nNow getting to the pizza, I ordered a build-your-own pie with pepperoni, spicy soppressata (a dry Italian sausage), sausage, and basil.  For cheeses I got provolone and fresh mozzarella.  The pizza took about 5-7 minutes to cook, which gave me and my friends time to play a quick game of uno.  Now the pizza came out and my firs thought was that it was a bit sparse on toppings, although it looked really good.  When you first go to pick up the pizza you will realize that the crust isn't sturdy enough to hold up to the sauce and the middle was quite soggy.  Although the pizza had these problems the flavor was great, with the toppings tasting extremely fresh and the sauce and cheese complementing each other.  My favorite part though was the chewy crust, which was cooked perfectly.\n\nAlthough Doughocracy has some problems, the most important part of a restaurant is how the food tastes, and the flavors of the pizza are actually very good.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87df355388774977:0xa0fda590e777ee64"}

We waited 30 minutes before anyone took a drink order. It was another 15 minutes before the drinks showed up. The table would order another round from one staff member, be approached by a second staff member 5 minutes later asking to take our order, and the 10inutes after that a 3rd person would show up get the order and beginning delivering drinks. They missed out on selling a lot of booze because they we so unorganized.   We ordered appetizers and only got half of the ones we ordered. The organizer of the evening never got her entree. We cancelled her order after we waited 15 more minutes and then asked for the bill.  None of the staff seemed to be communicating with one another. The food we did get was ok, many of the dishes were cold by the time they got to the table. Portion size was small, but it is not terribly expensive. It was overall very disappointing, but they did apologize and take care of the bill. Overall, the lack of coordination amongst the staff and mediocre food means we won't go back. Maybe with only a 2 or 4 top the experience would be better and it is likely that food didn't get a fair shake because of the service.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8caa497d8d779:0xb2c465671d1a2cf1"}

Nope. The fondant tasted better than the cake, and I'm not a huge fan of fondant. I enjoy baking but typically have less than stellar results when I attempt cakes from scratch. This tasted like one of my yellow cake fails that resembled dry cornbread.\n\nNone of the kids liked it and opted instead for the ice cream...which was generic vanilla and cost about 95% less than this cake.\n\nI hereby withdraw my name from the M.O.T.Y. race.\n\nDefinitely disappointed.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b3a064068757:0xeae0ab97834da619"}

I'd say it's almost a given since this is a hotel restaurant that it's expensive, but I'll say it anyway, it's expensive.  Your best bet is to go with the buffet since it is all you can eat for $15 and it includes drinks, that compared to just a normal egg breakfast without drinks for $13, and with the included omelet station it's the obvious choice.\n\nThe good is that there is a pretty wide selection, from the hot items with bacon, sausage, potatoes and eggs and omelet station. to the fresh fruit and pastries as well as oatmeal and variety of toppings even freshly made smoothie shots.  Of course with any buffet there are always some items that suffer so expect that, one time the bacon was delicious and next time burnt to a crisp, another the waffles were great the next time old and cold.\n\nGood choice (and almost only choice) for a full breakfast in that immediate area around Union Station unless you go about 7-8 blocks","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b31de5f5865d:0x5d38dde7ca97ab19"}

There wasn't an option to leave your own amount, there was only the option for predermined amounts based on a full service experience. It's a little frustrating to be expected to tip 20% for a two minute visit and then I leave. I tip that while dining. So I'll bring cash next time.

This is a new shop and maybe you didn't know about it but that's why I'm here.\n\nSo I only tried one thing so far (after careful consideration) I got the cheese sauce and beef with fried onions and horsy sauce. It's something my Dad would of made. Feel good comfort food. But with homemade high quality ingredients (no offense to my dad's love affair with velveeta though). I forgot how to spell it but the bread is from La Bom Voucher (best bakery for decades).\n\nIt's less than $10 too. Which is a fair price for this quality coming from this location (it's an expensive area to operate in).\n\nThe owners name is Stephan. He looks young but had worked in restaurants for 15 years. This is the first one he has owned himself. And he is there working, doing everything, not hiding behind the scenes trying to take it easy. This guy hustles (and is polite while he does it).\n\nBut come for the food. I bet you be back a second and third and... You know..","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b528f7fbab37:0x457eb1581373a10b"}

Frankly it's insulting to anyone who has taste buds and can swallow. (It irritates me that the likes of Guy Fieri would endorse Provel, but then again, he's an Italian that can't pronounce Mascarpone correctly.) The  toasted ravioli and prefrozen pastas are passable, as are the salads, but you still can't escape the Provel. The sauces and house salad dressing are waaaay too sweet. The garlic bread is ghastly, flaccid and bland. Where IS the garlic?? Prices are horrific. That said, delivery service to the rest of my family has always been friendly and timely. On site parking is not the best. If you don't mind the sweet sauce, the meatball sandwich and the cannelloni are good. Salt helps.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8caf410f0cf6b:0x429f4d3dd1491ca0"}

I placed an order via telephone. What a busy business!\n\nI ordered one Regular Pie and one White Pie because I have a big appetite, and their pizzas are not huge. Yesterday, the pizzas seemed different from what I remember. They were definitely smaller than in the past, and the crust was extremely thin--almost Imo's like. The sauce was not as sweet nor the olive oil as plentiful as in past visits. There was also minimal basal. Picking up the pizza's at the window was seamless. I am curious if the recipe has changed a bit, or if this was because my order was later in the evening and near closing time. In the past, I always ordered right when they opened.\n\nFinally, the oven with the \"ST. LOUIS THE KING\" is definitely the coolest part of the entire experience!\n\nOriginal Review:\nAmazing pizza! This is easily the best pizza in St. Louis. The sweet sauce and cheese are so flavorful, and the secret of the pizza's excellence is the basil and olive oil. The crust really soaks in the wood fire flavor. The slices have the perfect flop. The 13\" pies are the perfect size to be eaten in one sitting. Highly recommended.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b3847b3f6ab3:0x749e091c168bb8c"}

Now the only thing I\u2019m going to say negative is that they are only 2 days out of the week so it hard to get our favorite pizza when craving it in the middle of the week. They have this sweet sauce that they put on the pizza it is to die for. Service is excellent, staff is so nice. Love the atmosphere. Definitely recommend. The crust you can definitely taste the wood fire. You don\u2019t get that a lot anymore now a days and by far wood fire pizza are my favorite.

The beautiful, small blue tiled pizza oven in the corner came from Italy, and provides a perfect wood-fired heat for a 5 minute cook time that gives an excellent heat and char for the crust.  My pizza's white sauce had a great rich and garlicky flavor.  Crust is hand stretched when you order, and was nice & bubbly on the edges with a good chew.

It taste delicious but it's pretty thin and I prefer something a little more dense. Regardless, the pizza was wonderful, crust and all. And one pie was perfectly sized for my husband and I.\n\nThe staff is really friendly and for how many orders they were pushing out, the wait wasn't bad at all. Be warned that the dining area isn't much of one. They have outdoor seating which is probably great when it's not January in St. Louis. But they only have a bar inside along the windows that seats 6. Most of their business seems to be carry-out from locals so seating ended up not being an issue.

Oddly you order pizza in one area of the restaurant but have to order beer in a separate area. It costs about 20 dollars for an entire pie with slices anywhere from 3 to 6 dollars. The pizzas are best when eaten immediately and lose flavor when Luke warm. Expect to pay anywhere from 27 to 40 dollars for an entire pizza and one drink a piece between two people. Some negatives are that the plates are paper. It just seems to add to waste unnecessarily when they could easily just use  washable plates. However, they do composte their trash.

But i was less than impressed and don't think I'll be going back. The restaurant is visible from Grand, attached to an international grocery store, with a private parking lot. You can enter through the grocery store, or from the parking lot. We ordered a lot of different dishes to really give this place a shot to impress us. With so many great reviews, maybe they just had an off night?\n\nThere is a not a hostess (understandably since the restaurant is small and not to busy), so we waited at the front door for 5 minutes until a server entered the dining room. We were one of three tables filled during our time there, so it felt very sad. There was one server that spent most of his time in the back.\n\nWhen in a Vietnamese restaurant, you have to order the pho. Unfortunately I found the broth bland. Not even adding the extra herbs, lime, hoisin or Sriracha on the table could save it. We also order spring rolls. The wrapped was chewy, so it didn't feel fresh. We've had better vermicelli bowls (served with some chewy steak) and bahn mi.\n\nThe smoke alarm in the restaurant was beeping once every minute the entire time we were there, screaming for the battery to be replaced.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b5d39f09f8b3:0x6d6bb8948d5e881"}

Instead she answered all of my questions, at the end gave me a tip on how to actually get through to a person, and let me know about the ability to have future packages go straight to their location for a nominal fee (which I will now be doing at least until my apartments admin office is available again).\n\nOverall Sharde and this location were extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and overall helpful.

A young guy brought my smoothie to the window, I gave him my $1 off receipt and noticed the drink was not filled to the top. A good 4-6 ounces were missing so I asked for it to be filled.\n\nHe left the window to do so and the woman who made the smoothie must have gotten offended so she came to the window and asked me to pay for my order very rudely. I explained to her that the young man had my $1 off receipt and the drink so I am unaware of the actual total.\n\nLong story short, she proceeded to give me more attitude and told me she would not credit the $1 off coupon. I told her that's fine and I no longer want the drink. She became even more hostile with me in her tone and body language and keep saying I can talk to her manager over and over after I repeatedly stated to her that it was okay, I no longer wanted the smoothie and asked for my coupon to be returned.\n\nBecause I wouldn't pay for the smoothie, she rolled her eyes at me, slammed the drive-thru window in my face, and walked off. The young man witnessed this interaction, looked at us both in shocked, apologized for her behavior and returned the coupon to me. I asked him for her name but he said it was his first day and he was unsure.\n\nBecause I like SK I called customer service within 5 mins of leaving that establishment and explained what happened. I was told someone would be reaching out to me and that never happened. Having disrespectful and rude employee should never be acceptable at any business.\n\nAnd to be clear, it wasn't her refusal to credit the $1 off the smoothie that was offensive. It was her demeanor, tone, and attitude. She present no quality in her interaction with a paying customer.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b4d9402dbc63:0xfacaab61097c800e"}

You would think that all people would be a little more humble, and show appreciation to a customer that's still able to get out and abou,t because we're trying to support in our community and eat lunch. Not only was the employee not knowledgeable about what Subway has to offer for a price she was rude and distance beware when you buy food from there. I will NEVER return.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b665be41f86d:0x30409a4fa9042d4a"}

{"user_id":1.129949069e+20,"name":"Cera Thomason","rating":2,"text":"Went to the Saturday dinner show with my boyfriend for his birthday. The show was amazing, someone did acrobatics and fire spinning and it was so cool to watch and I would love to go back; but just for the show. I'm giving 2 stars because 3\/4 of the dinner courses were disgusting. The salad did not have enough dressing or toppings, my piece of pork belly was all fat and inedible, and the bread pudding (chefs dessert choice) was dry and burned. The meal was way too expensive to be that nasty. The 3rd course (beef short ribs green beans, and mashed potatoes) was pretty good and I would have felt better about the price if the meal would have been a bigger portion of just that. I really wish the 7pm shows came with the option of skipping the dinner, because I would go back all the time if that were the case and I don't stay up late enough for the later shows or I would go to those. It really was an amazing show and $20 (I think that's the price of just the show) is a great price for that but that dinner was $36 per person and barely edible and just not worth it.","resp":{"time":1540234526401,"text":"Hi Cera,\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you didn\u2019t enjoy your evening here.

Ok so then she said she would just have the Peshawri Salad. He then said they do not have that ready!. This is two hours after they have been open. How do you not even have diced cucumbers tomatoes onions and green peppers with cilantro and vinegar and oil ready after being open two hours much less a meal item  on your menu.

Their bottle service is outrageous in price, the bartenders are not friendly, nor the cocktail servers. But price is price, I understand that. But what I don't understand is how our entire group got scammed at the door by the bouncer. I called in 2 times that day asking about ticket sales and then again later about the price. I was told both times that I had to just pay at the door and it was a $10 cover. I was fine with that. But instead it was $20 once we got there, and even the DJ we knew playing that night said it should have been only $10. So from the front door problems, to the unfriendly staff, and price of a bottle we all felt like we will not being going back to this club again. There were 13 of us that night, and not one person wanted to come back, not just on industry night on Sunday bc of the bad experience, but also probably never again. And to top it off, I called back the next night and was told to call another time bc the weekends are you busy to take complaints. On a Saturday night at 6 I would have to take any complaints or calls at my bar. Poor employee skills all around.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b341b61e374f:0x3ca5ff6b104af8da"}

{"user_id":1.116590558e+20,"name":"Richard J. Vargo","rating":4,"text":"Rating: 4.4 Stars\n\nThis was my first ever order from Pickles Deli. Because the Meatball Sandwich that I ordered from Pickleman's Gourtmet Cafe on Wednesday was still fresh in my mind, it made sense to order Pickles Deli's Meatball Sub. This would also allow me to compare it to the meatball sandwiches at Good Buddy's (the GOAT) and Gioia's Deli.\n\nI ordered on the website, and this was straightforward. They were also efficient at preparing my order when I picked it up. My major complaint here is regarding the Gooey Butter Cookie. The online menu says \"Gooey Butter Cookies\"--plural--but you only get one cookie per order. This was misleading and disappointing because I had to order a second cookie. However, after discussing this with someone on The Team at Pickles Deli, this online menu error was corrected.\n\nThe Meatball Sub was solid. It was very large and a little overwhelming to eat. The bread was fresh. Unlike other meatball sandwiches that I have had in St. Louis, this version only came with three meatballs. The sandwich had pretty good flavor, but its components weren't mixed well at all. They just put the meatballs in, poured sauce over it, put cheese on top, and then heated it up. Adding the cheese on the meatballs and between the meatballs and bread would have made for a better sandwich. Instead, I was left with a layer of melted cheese that I could easily just peal off and have no mozzarella at all. I am not quite sure what \"higher standard\" this is satisfying, but at least it is consistent with the photo on the online menu. I give Pickles Deli's Meatball Sub 3.8 Stars.\n\nDespite the disappointing (now corrected) error in plurality on the online menu, their version of the Gooey Butter Cookie was phenomenal, and it is the best Gooey Butter Cookie that I have had in St. Louis. It had amazing taste, the perfect sweetness, and the perfect fluffy and soft consistency. This saved the meal, and I really recommend it. The Gooey Butter Cookie will likely get me to come back in the future. I give Pickles Deli's Gooey Butter Cookies 5.0 stars.\n\nThe average of the two items comes out to the 4.4-star rating.","resp":{"time":1619617775542,"text":"Thank you very much for leaving us this detailed review, Richard, and for helping to point out the confusing wording on our online menu.

{"user_id":1.066155596e+20,"name":"Sandwich Club STL","rating":5,"text":"Sandwich Club STL visited Pickles Deli on Saturday around 1pm. We did a little research online beforehand to find a lot of good reviews and praises. We thought we better check it out for ourselves. First impressions upon walking in is the the layout is well planned with plenty of tables and its clean. The chalk board behind the counter is well laid out with some deli standards like a Ruben,Beef Dip,Meatball & Clubs.\nYou can also create your own sandwich from a pretty wide array of ingredients too. The staff was friendly and patient with some our less decisive members.The service was also pretty quick. Each of these traits earns them a star.We ordered The french Dip :-1\/2lb. shaved roast beef with melted swiss & au jus on a warm french roll. Which was awesome BTW Not soggy or fatty and the meat was of good quality. The portion size was good too not too big but not too small either, just right.We also ordered a Ruben :-corned beef or pastrami with sauerkraut, swiss cheese & 1,000 island dressing on grilled marble rye. One member said it was one of the best sandwiches shes had yet & we eat a lot of sandwiches. We got two Pickles Clubs one on Marbled rye and one on a pretzel bun. Oven roasted turkey breast, ham, bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado spread, Both were received well. We also got a New York Pastrami which I heard was excellent. Unfortunately our Meatball expert wasn't with us this time, (he's very picky, Lol) we'll have to go bring him next time. Over all we were very happy with Pickles. We think it deserves 5 stars all around.If you happen to be in the CWE and hungry you really cant go wrong here. Its Great. Oh and they have Beer and Wine (in a can). Fortheloveofsandwiches.

Pickles makes one of the best in the region. Choose between corned beef, pastrami, or my favorite, a combo. Both meats are shaved, cooked properly and neither too fatty nor dried out. The sauce is just right. The bread is perfectly toasted, and both sides remain correctly crisp (something of a Reuben unicorn) thanks to just the right amount of sauerkraut: enough to be very present in the overall flavor without being bulky and overpowering and making the sandwich soggy. Add great sides, a snappy dill pickle spear and excellent service and if you're like me you'll drive to a part of the city you dont often need to drive to just for the experience. Highly recommended.","resp":{"time":1570648154513,"text":"Aaron,\nHoly wow! We couldn't be happier to hear you approve our signature Reuben! Keep making that drive and we'll keep serving em' up!

{"user_id":1.095358712e+20,"name":"Frank Michael","rating":3,"text":"I don't know what \"St. Louis Style Pizza\" is, but if this is it, then I'm not a fan. Incredibly thin crust, but not doughy like NY style, where you can roll up a slice in half.  It's very crispy. I was expecting mozzarella, but they went very light on the cheese and it tasted like there might be provel mixed in it? (I hate provel) The sauce was also overpowering and tangy. The wings were decent. Moderately sized and slightly spicy, but overpriced. Over a dollar a wing? And you can't split an order of 12 wings between two flavors? It has to be two 6 wing piece orders priced separately? God forbid you have to rinse the tossing bowl out between 6 mild and 6 hot. The pizza must have also been sliced, \"St Louis Style\" which is little tiny squares of pizza.  Maybe I'm biased because I'm from NY, but I have yet to find a decent pizza place in The Hill\/Hampton Road\/ Tower Grove area, and I've been here for over 2 years. Suggestions welcome. I'd give this place 2\/5 stars, but this might actually be what the locals love, so I gave it 3\/5 based on quality, price, and extra points for a friendly staff.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8b59d10f0ecc3:0xbeab451156530175"}

{"user_id":1.067458226e+20,"name":"Izadora Dombrowski","rating":5,"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience. I ended up here with a friend, and was instantly attracted to the promise of Latin food. We were originally sat outside in the cutest alleyway but it was just a bit too cold still, especially in the later afternoon shade. We moved inside which was clean, beautifully decorated in a modern but comforting style. We ordered a couple local beers, served alongside frosted mugs. We decided to order the mussels in wine sauce and add more food later if we wanted. The mussels were wonderful. The wine sauce was good with just a hint of a kick that was unexpected and delightful. We devoured them. Next, we added two empanadas. I had the chicken, my friend the beef with olives. They were obviously freshly made, well-seasoned and authentic, and the chimichurri mayo to go with it was delicious. We tacked on a couple more beers (a sure sign that we were really enjoying the ambiance and wanted to stay). For dessert, we got empanadas, one dulce de leche and one guava. My mate loved the dulce de leche and wasn't a guava fan (I think he just doesn't like guavas) which was just as well because I couldn't get enough of the guava empanada.\nAs for the restaurant, we felt safe inside, staff wore masks and it was very clean. The restrooms were very well-kept. Staff was personable and welcoming and service was spectacular. I am so glad we stumbled on this gem, and I can't wait to go back. It feels really wonderful to have authentic Latin cuisine here in St Louis. I felt at home and got a wonderful taste of flavours I had been missing. This was the perfect place to showcase culinary aspects of Latino culture to my friend. I just really, really enjoyed my experience.","resp":{"time":1617263368034,"text":"We are so honored for this 5 star review, thank you so much Izadora for taking the time to let us know how our team\u2019s hard work is appreciated.

{"user_id":1.180215898e+20,"name":"Kevin Nestor","rating":4,"text":"This place is pretty good. A couple things to keep in mind when ordering from places that make this style of thin crust st. Louis pizza: order the most common size pizza. Dont get a medium or small unless there is a really good special on them that day. The reason is this: their crusts come in plastic bags of about 25 or so crusts. They are stacked on top of each other with plastic sheets between them. They are otherwise exposed to the air. So, on slower days, or for less frequently ordered crust sizes, the premade crusts are exposed to the air for too long. This causes the crust to go from light and flakey to hard and crunchy, sort of a stale texture. If you order online, there is a special for bogo large or x-large pizzas. If you want to make sure you're getting the best freshness, order that special on a normal busy pizza day like friday or saturday. Avoid ordering right at 5pm because the lunch crusts have probably been sitting out all afternoon through the lul between lunch and dinner. And try not to order the first pizza of the day because at the end of the night the crusts are wrapped up and put back in the walk-in. They could have been sitting out for a long time the night before. If you order from the store at Weber and gravois and order delivery online, be ready for the delivery driver to be rude and say verbatim: \"this was an online order, so if you left a tip, thank you.\" Then promptly turns around and walks away before you can respond. This happened to me on at least ten occasions. Always the same guy. Other drivers dont say this, so it's probably not a store policy. I am guessing they cant see the tip until they cash out at the end of the night and this is his subtle way of saying \"dont forget to tip me!\" Deducted two star for frequently stale crusts, and added one  star for the consistently predictably rude delivery driver.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87d8c9ec28dc519d:0xb260bfa87c17f95"}

Great taste, more toppings, lower price. What was there not to love?\nThen all the Cecil's where I lived and worked (NW StL county and St. Peters) got complacent. It got to the point where even with coupons it just wasn't worth it.\nWe were feeling extremely lazy on New Years Day, and decided we wanted to give this location a try. I don't know if it's this location only or if all of them have gotten better, but it's almost like the old days. The young lady behind the counter apologized for my pizza taking so long, even though they beat the time on my online order by at least 5 minutes. And even gave me a \"Happy New Year\" on my way out the door.\nOrdered a large pepp and chef salad, both were perfect. After a 20 year hiatus, I'll be ordering from this Cecil's again.

It gives you the sense that if you order a pack of sliders you get multiple different sliders. That is not the case here.

It took so long to get our food as well.\n\nAlso if you come here to get drunk this is not the place the bartender is very light handed when it comes to pouring alcohol. It's crazy that on the receipt it says rum juice, personally it might as well have been juice because there was a dribble of rum in it.\n\nAnother thing that was kind of weird was the age group that was here, I'm in my late 20's and so was the person I brought but everyone around us was 40 and up.\n\nIf you go to TGI Fridays you can get three different sliders, the food is better, service is better, and entertainment is better which is sad because it's a chain.

Not greasy and well seasoned. In this case, adding seasoning at home would take away from the flavor. The summer rolls were well rolled but we dissected them (see below). The shrimp had been seasoned before putting in the rolls so you get extra boosts of flavor. The noodle dishes were balanced in flavor and my girls gobbled it up.\n\nThe service:  I did take out so I can't speak for sit down. That said, I did have something come up after getting home. The summer rolls looked like they had romaine so I called to let the restaurant know to look into the current E. Coli thing. The girl on the phone called me back about twenty minutes later. She called her boss after looking up the romaine situation (CDC says to eat NO romaine right now) and let me know they get Korean lettuce.
