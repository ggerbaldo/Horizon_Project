We  generally ate here every 4 or so months.  Yesterday (9\/24\/16), we found that the menu had been redesigned.  My two favorites the Porter House, and Peppercorn Ribeye had been removed from the menu.  My wife's favorite (the filet) now only came wrapped in bacon (indicating in my mind, that they are buying cheaper filets and they need to be wrapped in bacon to keep in some of the moisture).\n\nThe server told me she would have the cook prepare a Peppercorn Ribeye for me, that was the second star of this review, however it came with a sauce on it that I never remember seeing in 4 years.  Scraped that off the top, and was left with a perfectly cooked medium rare Ribeye that literally had no flavor to it at all.  My wife's filet looked perfectly medium rare, and she said it was virtually flavorless as well.\n\nSomething has happened to this location to make them lose their customer base, with the store only opening at 4:00 in the evening now, while being perfectly situated right next to a Huge (for this area) casino, a family oriented water resort lodge, the second or third largest shopping district in all of KC Metro, and 3 sports arenas (all in walking distance).\n\nThe service in the kitchen is lacking, and I think it's showing on the companies bottom line.","gmap_id":"0x87c08ea33be14589:0xafecb9b3a525cd57","fecha":"25\/09\/2016"}

They always have low fuel costs, and despite the claims of others, I've never had a \"problem\" by buying their gas.  But the gas is the least of the attraction for me.  Each store I've been in - and I've in a lot - is clean, well lit, and well staffed.  The people are excellent, probably because QT seems to treat them well.  I see a lot of nametags with 5, 10, or more years as an employee.  They greet and treat you well.  The products at the store are quality, especially those that require high quality - cooked foods, slushes, baked goods, sandwiches, etc. Along with that, the arrangement of the products at QuikTrips are nearly identical when compared to other QT's of the same store layout.   That means that if you like a certain product, you can not only find it in most any QuikTrip, but you can FIND it in almost any QuikTrip.  I happy that I don't have to hunt around to get the things I like.

Lastly, we found what I could only guess was a metal strip, that appreared to be from a steel wool scrubber, inside our enchilada. That was a very unusual surprise. I understand a stray hair, but this was long, shiney piece of metal in the food.\n\nThe tacos we took to go were highly regarded by our friends though.

I haven't seen this level of professionalism and customer service for a long time, and was beginning to wonder if it was a thing of the past.

The staff was very friendly. The food wasn't amazing, but it was good. The wife got tacos, which were exactly what you'd expect from a hard shell taco. Simple, and good. I'm picky about my biscuits and gravy, as well as my corned beef hash. So I decided to try both. The corned beef tasted like it came from a can, but it was prepared well, and served with some crunchy hash browns, as it should be. The B&G biscuits were good. The gravy tasted like it came from a can\/jar, but it wasn't bad. A little low on the sausage amount, too. But everything that came to my table was good. Prepared well, presented well, and served with a smile. I'll be returning.","gmap_id":"0x87c08e329b96cc0b:0xee9f17c943793b45","fecha":"16\/03\/2020"}

They also house a large keg room with around 100 craft and corporate beers. We\u2019ve been to location a lot for their great happy house on appetizers and beers and always had top-notch service. On this visit, we had to wait a little longer than usual to get our drink order in\u2014not a big deal at all, but the manager came out to our table to apologize and buy our first round of drinks. This was a classy move that I do not see a lot: a manager who cares about their customers\u2019 experiences and will do whatever it takes to ensure they have a nice time at their restaurant.\n\nI ordered their Abuela\u2019s Chicken ($18), a new entree with roasted pasilla, street corn, spicy rice, cilantro, and a chipotle sauce. It was just OK; the chichen was overcooked and came out dry. The sauce helped bring it back to life and added a good flavor. The street corn was fantastic, but the huge pile of white rice was confusing\u2014it should\u2019ve been spicy, but I was OK with it. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this entree and urge Yard House to retool it.\n\nMy date ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad ($15), with avocado, pasilla, corn, cheddar and jack cheese, tortilla strips, tomatoes, beans, fried onions, cilantro, and chipotle ranch dressing. She substituted the chicken for Garden, a meatless chicken product. This is her go-to selection and loves it\u2014especially when she makes the substitution. The kids ordered off the kids menu ($7 options) and went witht the burger\/fry combo and the cheese pizza\/edamame combo. They loved it\u2014I had to finish the burger and have to say it was tastey. The kids meals come with a drink and dessert\u2014so it\u2019s a definite pleaser at a good price.\n\nI would rate this experience as a 3.5, but since I can\u2019t rate on the halves, I will round up to a 4. They need to ensure the food coming out of the kitchen lives up to the premium price because people expect to get what they pay for and premium prices should yield premium dishes. Also, Yard House should lower their beer prices by $1 per pint to align with other bars\/pubs and restaurants and sell more craft beer.","gmap_id":"0x87c08eb821f5d7d3:0xb0b8d908222d80cf","fecha":"03\/04\/2019"}

Our server Dusty had 3 other tables and he was actively and convincingly avoiding us because we had kids. Our kids are normally great out to eat but they were restless when they have to wait over an hour to get their food. We sat there watching him take care of all of his other tables and made us wait for almost 40 minutes before taking our order. A large table sat down after us ordered before us and got their food and left before we got our food.\n\nA lunch date after church shouldn\u2019t take over 2 hours. Food was nothing too special either and they were also out of a lot of common and popular beers that I tried to order. $100 for that type of experience was highly disappointing and left the server way more than he deserved.

The menu offers all kinds of choices from southern cuisine, Cajun, and classic American. Now, this place is also known for its beer. There is more in this place than you can drink, and all of the ones I\u2019ve tasted are pretty amazing. There are TVs all over the place broadcasting pretty much every sport there is, and even though it\u2019s relatively loud inside, you don\u2019t have to shout in order for someone to here you. The staff does a great job considering the place is always full when we go, and they\u2019re always polite. Finally, the pricing is a little expensive but more than manageable. They even have mini task pads at the table that allow you to order another drink even pay for your meal. Overall, it\u2019s a great place.","gmap_id":"0x87c08eb821f5d7d3:0xb0b8d908222d80cf","fecha":"21\/03\/2018"}

Clean atmosphere and great drink selection and large menu.  Food was over priced for quantity and quality of food, better food at other locals.  We ordered the vodka shrimp pasta, fish and chips, Mac and cheese, and cheese pizza.  The vodka shrimp was fresh, however very little flavor. Fish and chips were ok, I would say average or maybe slightly better.  Our kids loved the Mac and cheese, I didn\u2019t taste it myself.  Pizza was good.

What better place to do our Xmas gift exchange? There was a wait to be seated, not entirely unexpected, but after ten or so minutes we were taken to our booth. Service overall was pretty good, but I was a bit let down that our server let a while go by between checking up on us - initially we were browsing the menu still, but then it got to the point of \"Where is she?\" for a bit. We weren't held up overly long though, and the food arrived very quickly and was delicious. Yardhouse has a huge selection of local and craft beers which I still need to try, but for my part the Guinness I'd been craving was great as well. And despite being in the middle of nowhere, the Yardhouse itself is at a pretty easy to get into and out of spot in the Legends, so it's hard to ding them for that.

After asking the waiter about the flavor of the Korean wings and being told that they were \"sweet and tangy\" I took one bite and they nearly melted my face off. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but everyone at my table tried a bit of the sauce and agreed that they were incredibly hot. Not wanting to waste food, and looking to man up and eat the fiery feast, I started looking for my waiter to ask for water and some blue cheese dressing to dip. After several minutes I finally saw him coming my way but he got stuck taking an order at another table. He later apologized for how long that took saying that one of the patrons had a lot of food allergy questions. Okay, fine. Nothing he could do about that. I understand. But I had pressed the CALL SERVER button on the electronic kiosk at my table and a blinking red light had been going off for nearly ten minutes before he finally made his way back to us. Never during that time did anyone else on the staff offer to help me. Where's the teamwork, guys? At least two other waiters had wandered by my table during that time and we were in view of at least two staff stations. When he finally got to my table, I explained that I could not eat the wings and needed water and dressing. He promised to get it right away. Five minutes later he was back with water, but no dressing. I was trying to keep a cool head (they're just wings after all) but he could tell I was getting agitated. Everyone at my table was nearly done with their meals and I had barely started eating. He apologized for not having the dressing saying that things were running a little slow in the kitchen. I told him to just get me a to-go box. Several minutes later the manager came over with a to-go box and a tiny bit of blue cheese dressing. I explained the situation and she apologized and offered to make me something else. Really? I had already been there an hour and everyone else had completed their meals. Come on. That is not a reasonable fix. Taking the wings off of my ticket and offering my party a free desert or two probably would have eased the tension, but she didn't do either of those things. After her apology, she walked away. When I went to pay my waiter it came up that she had not done anything to make things right, he took the initiative and took the wings off of my bill. Well, that was something I guess. We visit this restaurant regularly and normally have a pretty good experience. But this visit and especially this manager's attitude will probably mean that we'll choose differently next time.","gmap_id":"0x87c08eb821f5d7d3:0xb0b8d908222d80cf","fecha":"03\/04\/2019"}

The place was great with world class service. Since the past year I've literally drank at the bar at very least 2 to 3 times a week. I actually love the place its in my stomping grounds. Since recently they have revised the menu...dont worry everything's still there but alot higher :-)\n\"The way my bank account's setup\" ..I can stand the price increases (whop-dee-do thats the way of the world)\nBut what I really wont take is 1 Higher Beer Prices 2 Now pouring said Beer in Smaller Glasses and 3 Bartenders are now having a slight attitude. Maybe because the good ones are getting less hours idk? When I came in tonight felt like no one wanted to serve the bar.\nI'm what is considered a regular here and I leave a generous in my opinion 17-22% tips REGULARLY.  I don't expect someone to kiss my behind but yanking away dishware and slamming down drinks on the bar doesn't make you as a patron feel that appreciated. The food was never something you came specifically to YH for but just a extra to the large extensive drink selection. To raise the prices on this mess is laughable for some items. Also waiting at the bar for my next drink with a glass that clearly needs to refilled is unacceptable. The management is really going by the waste side. For years we've asked for some kind of rewards program or a email promotion, something For valued customers!!

{"user_id":1.092220883e+20,"name":"JC Kirk","time":1471333685762,"rating":2,"text":"I will explain why only the two stars.  Management everywhere seems to not want to \"make it right\" with their customers anymore and this restaurant is not an exception.  The reason is at the end of this review.  It is a big deal to me.\n\nWe get there later in the evening.  We are seated fairly quickly at a table.  We ask for a booth, a few minutes later, we get the booth.\n\nThe server was very nice and helpful but could have been more attentive and quicker (I waited on him for several minutes because he was cuttin' up with small talk at one of his other tables - this only happened once)  The menu was vast.  We ordered the crab, shrimp, and artichoke dip with chips and pita.  Amazing.  So good.\n\nI ordered the Ribeye Steak and Shrimp, I asked for a Caesar side salad instead of the broccollini (which is broccoli and asparagus married together) and they did that but the salad came out with the meal, I would have liked it before but the server did explain that it could be either way.  I ordered the steak medium and it was medium.  I noticed that it did get cold quickly but it was cooked exactly like I asked for.  The Shrimp were very large and actually more than likely Prawns.  They could have been cooked\/grilled a little bit longer since they were still a little tough and hard.  Heat should have broken the meat of the prawn down to chew easier.  The mashed potatoes were good.  The portion was enough and filled me completely.\n\nMy friend ordered the Roast Beef.  Big portion, we took half of it home.\n\nThe vast variety of beer on tap was amazing.  Several to choose from.  The six pack samplers were limited though, as they have pre-selected these and you couldn't build your own, bummer.\n\nRemember that steak that was cooked perfectly yet got cold quickly?  I was almost done with it when I felt a prick in my mouth.  I pulled out what I know was a small piece of wire from a wire grill cleaning brush.  It was tiny, I hope I didn't swallow anymore of these before I got to this one.  The wire was about 1\/4 of an inch long.  Hard to find.  So I sat it down on the plate.\n\nI have had this happen to me on my home grill.  The wires that I have found then were about 3\/4 of an inch long, making it easier to spot before ingesting.  I found a very stiff nylon brush that is made for cleaning grills, so I bought one and will never use one of those wire brushes again!\n\nThe server came by.  I showed him and explained everything to him.  I didn't finish my steak.  Almost, but not quite.  The server takes the side plate and goes to show his manager.  A few minutes later, the manager (white male, bald?) comes out to our table.  I explain to him after he asks me if I was okay.  He did ask me if I was okay, which is very good.  I explain everything to him and tell him how I found the nylon brush and that he should try to find something similar and stay away from the wire grill brushes.  He agreed, said thank you and then left.\n\nI never asked for a comp.  I do, however, expect one.  Especially in this situation.  I'm not talking about a full comp of the entire meal.  When I buy a $33 steak and shrimp entree then I expect it to be perfect.  It was not perfect.  I had potential for injury.  There was a piece of metal in\/on my steak!  Now, do something.  Comp half of it.  Comp all of it.  Don't make me ask you.  Do it.  Tell me that you are going to do it.\n\nBy the time anyone reads this, the evidence is gone.  They took it and clearly knew what it was.  I hope they correct this issue.  I'm very surprised that this was the first time a piece of metal grill brush got onto a piece of meat and served.\n\nA high class establishment such as this, a $20 comp wouldn't hurt their bottom line nor would a comp of the entire meal, which was over $80 with tip.  Shame on the Yard House customer service on Friday, August 12, 2016.","gmap_id":"0x87c08eb821f5d7d3:0xb0b8d908222d80cf","fecha":"16\/08\/2016"}

It looks nice, it's always clean, the employees look decent and the in-store service is good (though delivery service may vary). It used to be that Domino's was hit or miss when it came to the flavor of their pizza and service. For a while I wasn't too impressed with them because the crust tasted like cardboard and the delivery times were often longer than reasonable. I stopped eating it for a long while. Corporate made some national changes and it's better now to a certain extent. What I don't like is they put garlic on the crust of every pizza unless you tell them not to, and it's very garlicy (is that a word?). Way too much garlic...Some of the topping flavors are still bland and while they say they've improved the sauce, it's okay but also fairly bland. Domino's offers great specials from time to time (like 50% off) which is a definite bonus for them because it's hard to justify spending $12 - $15 on a pizza there. At that price there are MANY better options around. I personally prefer to eat at locally owned businesses, but if I had to order Domino's, this store would be my choice over others in the area.","gmap_id":"0x87c0904b7776c777:0x8174976fa65eef24","fecha":"10\/04\/2016"}

Same price, half the food and noticeably not the quality. Sister casino but no comparison.\n\nWe had this place on our radar for a couple months and when the time came we were quite excited to be trying the Epic buffet. (It's a 130mile each way day trip). It was around 5 when we went in, it's been open maybe an hour already\n\nRight away we discovered there was no soup. That stopped my wife right there. She asked and was told it'd be right out. Ok, she gets a salad and sits to wait for the soup. After several minutes, she ask and again was told it was coming right out. Finally she just went ahead and ate her salad. But still no soup. In fact it wasn't until we were on our way out that the soup showed up. Felt bad for the young lady running the salad station, she wanted that soup out there too so people could quit asking.\n\nThe food was ok but nothing stood out as great. To be 'epic', something has to be great. The salad was fresh and crispy and I'm one who appreciates that.\n\nThe main attraction and the reason why the price is $38.99 on Friday is the Crab Legs. They were quite large, they snapped good to open but the meat wasn't sweet and flavorful. Tasted like they had been steamed \/cooked just a little too long.\n\nOverall the place felt dated and ready for a major facelift.

The so scalled self proclaimed store manager was taking my order through the drive through. He never once allowed me to even finish a sentence when placing my order. Part of my order was a nacho box. Because i have a bad tooth, i requested that all my chips be bagged separately from the toppings. He immediately told me \"NO!. There is no way i can do that\" I questioned his denial because numerous times before it was allowed. He then went into a ranting rage using the term \"You People\" always try to get extra chips from us and I'm not having it\". He never once thought of me, the consumer and how i would enjoy my meal. Before completing my order he demanded to know what i wanted to drink. Before giving him my drink order i asked him to confirm that my chips would be placed on the side. He shouted at me that we were passed that and he wanted my drink order. Vulgar words were thwn exchanged between both of us after that. I am so appalled by the way i was treated when asking for such a simple request. Please reach out to me so i can further inform someone from corporate or the owner about this terrible experience i had. When i asked for his name he refused to give it to me and said that he was the store manager and my complaint would go to him and nothing would be done. The fact that he treated me so horrible is a representation of the type of business is ran at location and how they feel about their loyal costumers. Shame on that employee for how horrible he treated me and my family. I will never go back to that location and will take my business elsewhere because of him.","gmap_id":"0x87c0904c59f839e7:0xf9ceb0c7bce7c16d","fecha":"21\/09\/2020"}
