Yesterday (9\/24\/16), we found that the menu had been redesigned.  My two favorites the Porter House, and Peppercorn Ribeye had been removed from the menu.  My wife's favorite (the filet) now only came wrapped in bacon (indicating in my mind, that they are buying cheaper filets and they need to be wrapped in bacon to keep in some of the moisture).\n\nThe server told me she would have the cook prepare a Peppercorn Ribeye for me, that was the second star of this review, however it came with a sauce on it that I never remember seeing in 4 years.  Scraped that off the top, and was left with a perfectly cooked medium rare Ribeye that literally had no flavor to it at all.  My wife's filet looked perfectly medium rare, and she said it was virtually flavorless as well.\n\nSomething has happened to this location to make them lose their customer base, with the store only opening at 4:00 in the evening now, while being perfectly situated right next to a Huge (for this area) casino, a family oriented water resort lodge, the second or third largest shopping district in all of KC Metro, and 3 sports arenas (all in walking distance).\n\nThe service in the kitchen is lacking, and I think it's showing on the companies bottom line.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87c08ea33be14589:0xafecb9b3a525cd57"}

They always have low fuel costs, and despite the claims of others, I've never had a \"problem\" by buying their gas.  But the gas is the least of the attraction for me.  Each store I've been in - and I've in a lot - is clean, well lit, and well staffed.  The people are excellent, probably because QT seems to treat them well.  I see a lot of nametags with 5, 10, or more years as an employee.  They greet and treat you well.  The products at the store are quality, especially those that require high quality - cooked foods, slushes, baked goods, sandwiches, etc. Along with that, the arrangement of the products at QuikTrips are nearly identical when compared to other QT's of the same store layout.   That means that if you like a certain product, you can not only find it in most any QuikTrip, but you can FIND it in almost any QuikTrip.

The salsa was delicious and queso came with our meals so that was a bonus.\n\nUnfortunately, I over heard that the waitress shorted the table behind us $10 and they were pretty upset. It might have been due to the time of day, but I feel the place was moving a bit slow. Only one waitress helping out. Took a while to get more chips (until the meal came) and another table waited for a long time for their check and boxes. My partner and I each found 2-3 bay leafs in each of our dishes, plus one in the black beans. I understand the need for flavor, but I think they should be removed before serving. Lastly, we found what I could only guess was a metal strip, that appreared to be from a steel wool scrubber, inside our enchilada. That was a very unusual surprise. I understand a stray hair, but this was long, shiney piece of metal in the food.\n\nThe tacos we took to go were highly regarded by our friends though.

It looks nice, it's always clean, the employees look decent and the in-store service is good (though delivery service may vary). It used to be that Domino's was hit or miss when it came to the flavor of their pizza and service. For a while I wasn't too impressed with them because the crust tasted like cardboard and the delivery times were often longer than reasonable. I stopped eating it for a long while. Corporate made some national changes and it's better now to a certain extent. What I don't like is they put garlic on the crust of every pizza unless you tell them not to, and it's very garlicy (is that a word?). Way too much garlic...Some of the topping flavors are still bland and while they say they've improved the sauce, it's okay but also fairly bland. Domino's offers great specials from time to time (like 50% off) which is a definite bonus for them because it's hard to justify spending $12 - $15 on a pizza there. At that price there are MANY better options around. I personally prefer to eat at locally owned businesses, but if I had to order Domino's, this store would be my choice over others in the area.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x87c0904b7776c777:0x8174976fa65eef24"}

The link went live today and your order came over the phone thru an automated message. However, it was partially read to the server over the phone and did not include your full ticket. When you came in, our server mentioned to you that there was a 5 minute wait, because we had 3 other orders going out for delivery. Once you received your items, you mentioned an item was missing. Our cook informed you that she did not see that item on her ticket, apologized and had a staff member verify the order online. At that time, he logged online to view the ticket. That info was then disseminated to our cook, whom then started the second part of your order, which was completed in 2 minutes. At that time, we apologized for the error, which we noted as a technical error on EatStreet's end while you were in. Again, we apologize for the wait.

I am so sorry but I hate lies just fess up to your mistakes and run down to the store and get some butter these people payed a heck of a price! I have been to India 3 times where they use clarified butter and its even more rich than regular butter. What they were trying to pass of was indeed cooking oil. I think people with health issues might suffer from some problems if they went ahead and ate that stuff. I will say that when I complained of the cooking oil and after the lie they very nicely agreed to get me real butter as they also did for a few others I overheard complain.

Sister casino but no comparison.\n\nWe had this place on our radar for a couple months and when the time came we were quite excited to be trying the Epic buffet. (It's a 130mile each way day trip). It was around 5 when we went in, it's been open maybe an hour already\n\nRight away we discovered there was no soup. That stopped my wife right there. She asked and was told it'd be right out. Ok, she gets a salad and sits to wait for the soup. After several minutes, she ask and again was told it was coming right out. Finally she just went ahead and ate her salad. But still no soup. In fact it wasn't until we were on our way out that the soup showed up. Felt bad for the young lady running the salad station, she wanted that soup out there too so people could quit asking.\n\nThe food was ok but nothing stood out as great. To be 'epic', something has to be great. The salad was fresh and crispy and I'm one who appreciates that.\n\nThe main attraction and the reason why the price is $38.99 on Friday is the Crab Legs. They were quite large, they snapped good to open but the meat wasn't sweet and flavorful. Tasted like they had been steamed \/cooked just a little too long.\n\nOverall the place felt dated and ready for a major facelift. I hope it happens someday, maybe soon, as that is the only way I'll be interested in going there again.","resp":{"time":1577112522030,"text":"Kent, we are so sorry you had a bad experience with us.

It wasn't very busy which is always a bad sign on a buffet because food sits longer and doesn't get replenished very often and gets dried out, bad looking.  Such was the case last night.  When we arrived the brown gravy was dried up and stuck to the container. Mashed potatoes were gone and dried.  There were 3 brussel sprouts sitting there by their lonesome.  The pork chops container was full but the top ones were dark and dried out like they been sitting there several hours.  That's just a few of the negatives.  Salad bar was ok.  Dessert bar fair.  Ice cream machine was out of vanilla.  We ordered chocolate milk to drink, each got one glass and lady said that was the last of the chocolate milk.   Really???

Normally buffet food is bland, flavorless, and very dull.  Buffet desserts are almost always just plain nasty!  This buffet blows me away every time I come here.\n\nThe selection isn't as big as some of the casino buffets in the area, but what they are lacking in selection, they make up in food quality!\n\nThe hot items are generally delicious.  The Meatloaf, Chinese Beef, and Mac and Cheese are amazing.  I love the pretzel sticks here!  They are buttery, salty, and warm.  YUM!\n\nDesserts are where this buffets truly shines.  Im talking SHINES.  The Key Lime Tarts are just amazing!  Im a HUGE fan of Key Lime anything, but normally in the midwest key lime anything is YUCK!  Not here!  The Red Velvet Cake, Carrot Cake, and German Chocolate Cake are top notch, 5 star restaurant quality.\n\nThe service can be hit and miss, but the servers are always nice!  Tonight, the service was 5 star quality.  She was friendly, efficient, and we were never left needing more drinks.  Our plates were picked up almost immediately after we finished.

The so scalled self proclaimed store manager was taking my order through the drive through. He never once allowed me to even finish a sentence when placing my order. Part of my order was a nacho box. Because i have a bad tooth, i requested that all my chips be bagged separately from the toppings. He immediately told me \"NO!. There is no way i can do that\" I questioned his denial because numerous times before it was allowed. He then went into a ranting rage using the term \"You People\" always try to get extra chips from us and I'm not having it\". He never once thought of me, the consumer and how i would enjoy my meal. Before completing my order he demanded to know what i wanted to drink. Before giving him my drink order i asked him to confirm that my chips would be placed on the side. He shouted at me that we were passed that and he wanted my drink order. Vulgar words were thwn exchanged between both of us after that. I am so appalled by the way i was treated when asking for such a simple request. Please reach out to me so i can further inform someone from corporate or the owner about this terrible experience i had. When i asked for his name he refused to give it to me and said that he was the store manager and my complaint would go to him and nothing would be done. The fact that he treated me so horrible is a representation of the type of business is ran at location and how they feel about their loyal costumers. Shame on that employee for how horrible he treated me and my family.

We each had the Taco Tuesday special, 4 tacos that came with chips and a drink for $8.00. Wow!!!  Awesome value and VERY good authentic street tacos.  6 different meat fillings to choose from plus shrimp and fish.  Made to order, no skimping on the meat.  We dined in.  They have Burritos, Quesadillas, and few other things, sides and daily specials.    Locally owned, not some franchise.  We can't wait to go on a Friday and try their Quesabirrias special and a Saturday to try their Chili Colorado Burrito special.  If you know what Quesabirrias and Chili Colorado are, then you know Juan Jose's is truly authentic Mexican food.
