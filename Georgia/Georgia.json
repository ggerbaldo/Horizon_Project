{"user_id":1.119617622e+20,"name":"Lora Kling","rating":1,"text":"I can't even describe how disappointed we were!  The location of this funky casual trattoria is in the very upscale and trendy Star Provisions neighborhood, home to the eponymous Star Provisions market and award-winning Bacchanalia; and that, combined with the tantalizing smells from the kitchen, led us to believe we were in for an authentically delicious Italian dining experience.  Wrong! The best thing about the meal was the bottle of  San Pellegrino sparkling water. It was served without ice or lemon. We had to ask for both. The caesar salad LOOKED great, but there was absolutely NO flavor whatsoever. Not even a hint of anchovy, garlic, or lemon. No taste at all.  We asked for fresh lemon for both the water, and the salad.  It was a great improvement to both.  From there it was just straight down hill. My eggplant parmesan was the worst I ever had.  I am Italian. I have had a LOT of eggplant parmesan.  This was the worst.  Skinless, very thinly sliced, no breading, watery, and completely and utterly tasteless.  The marinara was sparse, pale, bland, and equally tasteless.  This eggplant parmesan takes the prize for worst ever. My husband's lasagna was a bit better, but it too was pretty awful!  No ricotta, mostly crumbled sausage and again, the bland lifeless tasteless tomato sauce.  This meal was a disaster.  It was $29.00.  After we received our food we understood the management's policy of having you order your food off the wall menu at the front desk and paying for it before you get it. I know we would have had a hard time forking over $35 (with tip)for the stuff that came out of that kitchen. My Italian grandfather would have thrown it in the trash--right where it belonged.  Not good enough even for compost. If you want good food (especially Italian), go somewhere else!  But, if you like dull, bland, tasteless, expensive food--this is the place for you.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f504e989150ed1:0x2e64fecf456c7407"}

I decided to surprise my husband with a 15 course Omakase dinner for his birthday since his birthday trip to Japan got cancelled. Figured it'd be the next best thing. Chef Yun put together some incredible dishes, and it was fascinating watching him work. I have never been a huge fan of sashimi or nigiri so I was lowkey terrified I wouldn't enjoy it but turns out I just haven't been trying good quality fish haha. Most just melted in our mouths and it was really cool to see how each fish brought out a different flavor. Perfect amount of food to feel full but not uncomfortably so. We also enjoyed conversing with Sophia, who was a wealth of information and helped explain a lot. My husband loved his birthday experience, and I learned that I love (good) fish so I'm even more eager to take our trip to Japan whenever that happens.

I walked in and there was only one person behind the counter, and the other staff member who was there was hiding in the back. Neither of them were wearing masks until I came up to the counter to order, and that alone is a massive health risk when preparing cold drinks. Some of my coworkers joined me shortly after I ordered, and despite many of them ordering online, the details of the drinks were forgotten. Some of the drinks didn't have sugar in them, and it took us over 30 minutes for the group of us to get our drinks. Might have been a first day rush type of situation, but when comparing this establishment to the others in Midtown, it does not hold its own very well at this moment in time.\nAnother issue that I noticed is that this location was not prepared with the equipment needed to be a successful Boba tea caf\u00e9. They were using the same hand immersion blender for all of the drinks, and not a series of separate blenders to differentiate between their cheese\/dairy foam items, almond milk, and other types of beverages. I think I saw them briefly rise it in between, however there needs to be better equipment and food safety practices. Those who are vegan or lactose-free could possibly have a bad time due to lactose getting into their drinks from a hand blender not being properly washed.\n\nI would love to give this place 5 stars and update this review at a later date, however my experiences here have me easily picking one of the other Boba tea places located in Atlanta in the meantime. I hope this caf\u00e9 takes this feedback sincerely between now and the next time I might choose to return.","resp":{"time":1605299110326,"text":"Hi Sam, thank you so much for taking the time to leave us a detailed review.\nWe value our customers' responses as it helps us continuously improve. We are really sorry you weren't happy with your experience. At Tea Corner, we take our employees' and customers' health very seriously. Masks are never removed while customers are present nor during the preparation of food or drinks.\nWe continuously review the number of staff needed on any shift, however, given the increased risk of COVID-19 spread with higher numbers of people in close proximity, and the reduced traffic, we are choosing to limit the number of staff behind the counter at this time, and we have found we are able to keep up with demand like this.\nAs for the employee in the back, they sometimes need to go to the back to make more boba pearls, wash dishes, stock shelves, fetch ice, etc. Also, we apologize for any mix-up with the online orders you mention, all our customers that day ordered at the counter, so we're not sure what may have happened there.\nFurthermore, we appreciate your suggestions about preparation equipment and techniques, however we believe our method is superior to others for several reasons:\n1) Our method is easier and faster to clean than with a countertop blender (ingredients sticks to the sides of those).\n2) We get better taste and creamier texture.\n3) It wastes less ingredients.\n4) We can make each drink fresh for each order.\nAnd last but not least, all the drinks at Tea Corner are made with care and love from our professional barista, hence the hand blending process. We do use different preparation cups for dairy and non-dairy products. However, we understand our customers may have a certain preference about this, so we have two countertop blenders that we can use if the customer so wishes.\nWe will always go the extra mile to satisfy our customers. Please kindly let our barista know if you don't like the drink or you think it was made incorrectly, we will make a new drink of your choice free of charge.\nOnce again, we really appreciate you taking the time to let us know your thoughts on how we could improve our service. On behalf of Tea Corner, I want to extend my sincerest apologies for the negative experience that you had, and we hope to see you all again soon to let us make it right."},"gmap_id":"0x88f505d174e640cf:0x1c6f41b8ae44b538"}

{"user_id":1.090164846e+20,"name":"One More Bite Blog","rating":4,"text":"One of the things I missed the most when moving from LA to Atlanta was the proliferation of amazing fresh cold pressed juice shops all over the city, that offered delicious drinks and food that were also great for health and wellness.  Especially as someone who loves to drink, more than eat, my vegetables (a necessary evil).  To me taste is the priority - and would help me actually consume more of what I know is better for me.\n\nSo I was delighted to find Clean Juice at the lovely Westside Village, offering bottled, fresh pressed juices as well as tasty healthy eats.   Grabbed some bottles of \u201cGreen\u201d made with all organic ingredients: celery, cucumber, ginger, kale, lemon, spinach, no GMOs, no hidden additives and no preservatives.  While there are a few juice shops in Atlanta, a lot of them tend to add sweet ingredients to overcompensate for the veggie taste - adding apple, pineapple or sweetened almond milk, which to me defeats the purpose \/ dilutes the benefits of the juice and makes it taste too sweet \/ makes me question sugar intake.  Maybe I\u2019m just more used to it after years of green juices from LA spots, but was happy to see that Clean Juice offers varieties that are more straight to the good stuff, no added sugary ingredients.\n\nFor purposeful sweet treat I also enjoyed the seasonal \u201cIncredi Bowl\u201d made with Acai blended with banana, spinach, blueberries, blue spirulina, vanilla, almond butter, honey, hemp protein & almond milk \u2013 topped with granola, strawberries, chia seeds, & coconut chips.  Every ingredient is organic.\n\nThe plaza that Clean Juice is in, is adorable and had patio tables safely social distanced - will definitely be back for lazy weekend afternoons.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f51b9363a289bf:0x6e0e7f09bff267fc"}

In the beginning service was good until we were told they no longer made the tequila wings that we wanted.  Why have it on the menu as we were told the new restaurant no longer wanted to carry them but they are still on the menu.  We asked for more chips and was told the kitchen staff had dumped the chip machine because they started breaking down the kitchen and was cleaning because they wanted to get out.  My reply was that it's not quitting time yet and what about what the customers want and need.\n\nNot to mention that the rice and beans came out as if they were sitting on the heating table all day because the top of my beans were dry, and the rice was uneatable.  I could not believe that a small bowl of cheese for fajitas was $1 and an extra charge for pico de gallo and sour cream.  Even with the butter\/steak knife I still could not cut my steak.  By this time I was ready to go especially when my waitress, Joy who was nice, forgot that I wanted to talk to the manager who never came over,  and just was forgetful and there were only 2 tables in the entire place.\n\nNOT to mention that one of the other female servers was sweeping the floor, inside the booths while we were eating.

Last, make sure that the food that you are serving them is the same that you would eat.  DISAPPOINTED at the quality of food served, and the type of service that was provided.

I've now visited for lunch, dinner and an afternoon cocktail. I live in the neighborhood so I usually like to give a business at least 3 chances to make their first impression. On this visit ( 03\/12\/16) I say at the bar and had a couple of drinks. Ebony was the bartender (an admittedly inexperienced one) and was unable to make the signature cocktails on the menu. She encouraged us to trust her and that would make drinks that she knew how to prepare. We obliged and was pleasantly surprised. For the life of me I can't tell you the names of any of those drinks, however they were great. Her brutal honesty about her lack of experience was also appreciated.\n\nWhile there the chef was preparing to photograph some new menu items for the website and allowed us to taste them. They were out of this world.\n\nI brought a few of my counterparts over for lunch on 2\/28\/16 and the food ranked Hugh among all of them.

I made a 6:30 appt for eyebrow threading but got off work early and decided to come anyway. They were able to see me early which was good. I sat in the chair and informed the lady that this was my first time so be gentle lol. The process started fine until she told me to stretch my eyebrow area and that's when the pain kicked it. I was blinking heavily which caused my eyes to water lol. I imagine if I had been maintaining them this would've been fine but since I hadn't I had to be broken in.

I have been getting waxed since I was 17 - sometimes on schedule, sometimes a year late. Sometimes I shaved in between. But ALWAYS with hard wax and always with either a Brazilian woman or with **Wax by Andreia** and I have never experience ANYTHING like this. I'm from Brazil and can attest Wax by Andreia is as close as it gets to a true BRAZILIAN experience for a true full wax.\n\nI'm sure it was an accident but I think it was an accident by someone who doesn't know what they're doing. She had me hold my own skin taut - something a professional is trained to do, aka not me and now I obviously see, not her. She did not stop when she saw blood and kept trying to wax the area. When she left the room, I finally got a view and it was no cut - it was a legitimate ripping gash. When she brought back the antibacterial cream, I had to ask her twice to replace her gloves.\n\nOverall they were kind about the incident and showed concern. She comped it which was a classy move. I'm sure this place does an amazing job waxing other body parts but I will only trust Wax by Andreia with my lady parts.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f505a61b1ee95f:0x71d1393789eaa41"}

Common courtesy would be to inform your patrons in the dining area that they are clearing the counter in case someone wants anything.

They have a very nice outdoor patio, to enjoy on nicer days. The tables on the inside are this light brown, wooden looking tables. I suppose to go with the theme of Thailand. Aside from that, there isn't much to the decor. The service is pretty good. You order at the register, receive a number, pick up utensils, and your food is brought out to you in about 10-15 minutes. They are very quick about taking the order and bringing the food out. The menu is well priced, the lunch entrees are about $9-10, and you receive a copious amount. You can definitely have enough left overs for another meal. The food is delicious and you can have it made to your taste if you ask. My favorite dish is the chicken pad thai, it's a noodle dish with some peanuts on top, it's absolutely delicious! Also, I'm a sucked for their Thai Iced Tea and I love that now you can make your own Thai Tea, because then you can alter it to your preference. Also, you can get refills!

He was grumpy and acted like he didn't want to be there. The other staff members seemed to act the same way.\n\nThe food: I ordered the Kickin' Kimchi Steak Bowl which is supposed to be spicy. It was not spicy AT ALL. It was bland and boring. And there was maybe two small pieces of kimchi in the whole thing and about six pieces of steak. Sad.\nMy friend ordered the massaman curry. It looked like a bowl of peanut butter soup  and he said it was pretty bland as well.\n\nCleanliness: Could have been better. We were there early, around 5:30, so it's not like they were busy, but everything seemed to need to be wiped down.

The wingettes tasted like they were fried the night before and then put in the freezer. The meat and the bone even looked old. My companion couldn't eat hers so she substituted it for Bacon, which they did with no issues and she was happy with the Bacon. I ate 2 of my wings and took the rest home for my dog. The eggs and the waffle were delicious.\n\nI'm sure they have great food but they should try not to serve customers old chicken because it was clearly not fresh.

The friendly staff acknowledge your existence when you walk in even though it's a seat yourself. The food is better than I expected on all accounts. Get the fish tacos for appetizer. My girlfriend received the Chimichurri Steak which was a crazy tender, savory perfectly grilled piece of beef. While I chose the Shrimp & Chicken w\/ Gritz. It was A-1 simply put.

Last time I've ordered something, missed 2 items. Okay, that's fine- I let that slide by. This time, missing Boba Tea... Okay, I can't keep paying for items I don't receive. I had to shine light on the problem. The guy told that Bento Hut couldn't find another driver to deliver the drink and were giving a refund.\n\nThis problem would have never happened if Bento Hut would have just taken the extra minute to look over the order, look over it again and make sure that the rice bowl is there, along with the side item and the drink. All you need to do is look over the receipt then look what's in the bag. If they don't match up, then something's missing. It's absurd that this keeps happening and it seems like people don't know how to double check the order before sending the delivery person on his\/her way to final destination.\n\nIt could be worse- I could have gotten food poisoning from the Boba Tea so I'm at least counting my blessings and trying to think positive about it not showing up at my doorstep, but please for the love of God- stop charging me for things if you can't fulfill the order.\nIf there's a problem whatsoever, call me. I'm actually not a hostile person so a phone call won't hurt anyone.\n\nThey are good for dining in, don't get me wrong. Their food is good which is why I keep dining in and ordering take out.\n\nThe whole business model works with a positive customer experience- you can have this $1,000,000 idea that sounds amazing but if you can't deliver, it's not worth much.\n\nJust some food for thought.

The Cookies, while made with great toppings, tasted fairly stale and without a flavor that popped.\n2) the cheesecake brownie was very tasty, the original brownie tasted like one I would make from a box.... just less fresh.\n3) The woopie pie was just a waste. once again the flavor did not match the appeal of the visual. I ate about half and tossed it.\n\nOverall I am disappointed. I was coming in after reading an MSN article that said that Cookie Studio had the best cookie in Georgia.

I really felt special like my business was so important to them. I ordered a custom cheesecake for my boyfriends birthday. I called about two days ahead and asked them to create a Grand Marnier Cheesecake with strawberry topping on the side. They did exactly what I asked with zero objections or restrictions and the price was UNBEATABLE.....they were so accommodating. When I finally sliced the cake it was the lightest, fluffiest, creamiest, most delicious homemade cheese cake EVER!! Real fresh whipped cream on top!!! It really enhanced the occasion and I am so glad that I ordered that fresh homemade cheese cake instead of going with a grocery store pre-made bakery  cake!!! If you have not tried CEG Bakery you need you need to try them ASAP!!!!","resp":{"time":1494361603460,"text":"Ashley, we are so glad you loved the cheesecake!

I didn't think much of it then, as getting someone's phone number wrong is a mistake anyone can make.\n\nThe pizzas took about 45 minutes to arrive, which was pretty standard. The delivery person was pleasant, and did her job as well as she could have. No complaints on this end either.\n\nThe problems started when I opened my one of the pizza boxes and realized that the young woman on the phone had entered my order incorrectly, resulting in my getting the wrong pizza. Sarpino's has a \"100% customer satisfaction guarantee\", so I called them up to fix the issue, only to walk away disappointed. The gentleman on the phone started out by insisting that there was no way to figure out what had gone wrong with my order, as \"the system\" reflected that I had gotten the correct order.\n\nSecond, the person on the phone wanted to resolve the situation by sending someone over to pick up the incorrect pizza, and then have me wait another 45 minutes for another pizza to be delivered; at this point I was starving and just decided to keep the pizza I got, as there are worse things in the world than a cheese pizza.\n\nSarpino's would not refund my order or give me a credit towards a future order because \"the manager went home\" meaning that the entire incident ended without any kind of resolution whatsoever.\n\nIn terms of the quality of the pizza itself, the food was fine. It's a step above Domino's or Pizza Hut, but it can't really compete with Varuni Napoli, Sapori di Napoli, Rosa's Pizza, or Shorty's - pick one of those four in the future for better pizza and better service.","resp":{"time":1538416661578,"text":"Dear customer\nSorry for your experience\nPlease let me know the phone number you used for the ordering and I will apply a credit for you to use next time\nOnce again I am truly sorry about the service you received from Sarpino\u2019s\nSincerely\nIryna Dziatko\nGeneral manager\nSarpinos Atlanta"},"gmap_id":"0x88f505034c564447:0xe36f1f3bb2652e8a"}

With the City of Atlanta, County, and state tax (8.9%) The total should have been $23.96. We got charged $25.90, and paid cash. Still put a dollar in the tip jar before I got back to my place of work and realize what happened. There was never a receipt offered and now I know why.\nThis guy is running the oldest scam in the book and doing it to busy unknowing patrons try to grab a quick bite on their short break from work. I researched the truck and this is a recurring problem.  The owner is the one ringing people up, so dont listen to any claim of a rogue employee.\nIf he does this to 100 people a day, this is 200 extra bucks in this guys pocket every day. Even 200 events a year puts him up $40,000 of unearned money.\nDo not support this truck. Atlanta is full of great, honest food trucks. Gyro Chef Atlanta should never be on that list.\n\nEDIT: Again, $22 plus tax in Atlanta is not $25.90. I am not accusing your employees. I am accusing YOU, the fraudulent owner. Your employees seem great. Hate that you subject them to such bad leadership. Many other reviews state the same as I have today. Your food is good, if you need to raise prices, people will understand, but don't try to obtain it in an underhanded way. That is wrong and you know it. The POS has nothing to do with it.

{"user_id":1.001183074e+20,"name":"The RedFox","rating":3,"text":"I came to Restaurant Eugene for a little get-together with some old friends from my university.\n\nThe interior is dimly-lit and the decor gives a sense of intimacy that is found at perhaps only one other restaurant: Bacchanalia.\n\nService-wise, I couldn't be more satisfied. Servers were synchronized in setting the plates as well as taking them. They were not overly intrusive but still attentive just to the point of being extremely convenient.\n\nA major plus here is the wide-selection of various spirits; namely, the imported types. If you like whiskey, definitely try the ones from Japan; surprised that R|E didn't offer a tasting flight for whiskeys. Shouldn't a caliber of R|E offer one?\n\nBathroom was nice until I tried to flush the wall urinal which seemed to be broken. Good thing they had towelettes instead of coarse paper to dry my hands with.\n\nBut why three-stars, one might ask? Everyone else on here seems to give R|E four, if not five, star ratings. Good question.\n\nThe answer? The food.\n\nAnd not for the lack of quality. It's due to the lack of meeting the expectation.\n\nI ordered the tasting menu for $165 pp. I was expecting some unique dishes that would not be found elsewhere in Atlanta for that price. The food itself was, for the most part, a non-issue in terms of quality, plating, and flavors.\n\nThe issue was how nearly every dish so derivative and normative that it can be found at half the other restaurants in Atlanta.\n\nI can recall that I tasted lobster, squab, foie gras, and caviar on some kind of fish. I forgot to jot down everything so I cannot recall all the dishes (which were 8 in total).\n\nI won't go into detail of the dishes themselves mainly due to lack of memory and due to the fact that a caliber such as R|E would of course serve dishes prepared sufficiently, if not more.\n\nWhere was the kobe beef (Hell, I'll settle for domestic wagyu too)? Where was the truffles (I'll even take black over white at this point)? Where are the imported oysters (It is oyster season and I would accept ones from Canada)?\n\nThe only interesting dishes that could be argued for are the caviar and foie gras.\n\nCall me spoiled, I suppose, but I expected more of a deviation from other restaurants. I thought it would be something to really exclaim and be in complete awe at.\n\nPerhaps it was just my inflated expectations.\n\nOr perhaps they should try a little harder next time.\n\nWho knows.\n\nI'll be back to dine here again. That's for sure.\n\nBut don't get the tasting menu without first seeing what they serve.\n\nYou wouldn't want to get disappointed.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f505a5c47aa8dd:0xda73e772c8b472e0"}

First dining room is small, quaint, and easily overwhelming with the stereo turned up. We choose a table in the hybrid patio. Hybrid = step out the back door to a roof - covered area that is bordered by the back wall of the main building and roll up garage door\/walls. There is a small bar in the corner. Very neat space, with additional seating on the actual patio that is on the other side of the garage doors. Great view of freedom parkway trail. Food was excellent. Delicious guacamole, although very small serving for two. Goat cheese enchiladas and veggie fajitas were delicious. Our server was great, although during our visit it seems another server did not show up. Good thing hostess and bartender stepped in to help. Fair warning: since the back area is technically a\"patio\", they allow dogs in there. During our visit, I was tapped a couple of times by the wagging tail of a passing dog; watched the ladies at the next table get the same experience - but they were (understandably) upset and asked to move to another table. Their server (not ours) said of course, but never offered to help. The ladies bussed their own table. I'm a dog person so I let it go, but if you're not - consider yourself warned. There are no signs about dogs. I got the feeling this is a neighborhood bar, so if you don't how things work here, oh well.

Food was delicious and cooked to perfection. The drinks were unique and beyond words. My martini had nitrogen in it so it smoked (so cool and unique as they make it at the table). There was a whole section of the menu dedicated to potatoes and the 12 or so different ways they prepare them- I wish I could've tried them all but I will definitely be back to do just that! The dessert was also incredible and such a huge portion it was made to share!\n\nWe had to wait awhile for our dessert because all of a sudden at 8:30 the restaurant got over taken by people. The manager came over to apologize and comped us an appetizer the next time we go. Very thoughtful and considerate. 5 star experience all the way. It's also very pricey so be prepared to drop some money.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f505f3e5058edf:0xed8139ad58467e97"}

{"user_id":1.028382096e+20,"name":"#BefriendYourBrand LLC","rating":4,"text":"Elegant and sets the standard for \"trendy\"...\n\nUpon entering the establishment we were greeted by several different staff members with smiles then promptly seated outside.  It was such a lovely day with an awesome breeze.  Seems as if everyone had the same idea because the restaurant was pretty empty inside.  The outside dining area is pretty small maybe 8-9 tables so I can imagine that it fills quickly.  There are ceiling fans and warming lamps so it is a good choice when the weather is fair.\n\nRandom thought-- 90% of the men and women who work there are handsome and beautiful!!! It must be a part of the criteria???\n\nService:  Very friendly staff.  We had a great waitress who was prompt but we were also serves by a maitre d, manager and some other hospitality person.  People were constantly walking around asking if we needed anything or for drink refills.  It always great when there aren't people saying \"Let me get your waitress for you.\"  Instead they simply got drinks and took orders when needed.  LOVED IT!  Food and drinks were served quickly and plates and silverware refreshed almost instantly.  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about service.  Ocean Prime is at the top of my list.\n\nDrinks:  All of my reviews include alcohol right?  Well I had several.  I fell in love with the Pear Grapefruit Fizz.  It was more of a spritzer than an alcoholic drink but it was delicious.   It went perfectly with the atmosphere.  After two of those, I opted for something more potent... I'm not sure if it has a name but there is a large bottle of pineapples that have soaked in vodka.  I had a chilled glass of whatever that was.  I want to just call that danger in a glass.  When you have vodka that tastes like pineapple juice you can lose awareness of what your drinking.  Of course that's not my story but beware.  It's a must try.  Lastly chilled shots of Patron and Don Julio to finish the visit.  We were there for hours folks!\n\nFood:  I ordered the Crab Cake appetizer, Calamari and Truffled Mac & Cheese.  The Crab Cake was plated nicely with crisp corn succotash (corn\/cherry tomatoes).  It had large amounts of crab meat but the flavor was just okay.  The Calamari was a winner.  It was fried crisp and tossed in a sweet Thai chili sauce.  It didn't look very fancy but the portion was pretty large.  The Mac & Cheese stole the show for me.   My date may not have been super impressed by it but I was willing to lick the bowl and high-five the chef.  It was cheesy and very flavorful, a mixture of cheeses and topped with parmesan cheese.  Makes a belly happy.  In my humble opinion if you do not order anything else just get the macaroni.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f505f3e5058edf:0xed8139ad58467e97"}

Nothing wrong with that in ANY way. However I have had frequent customer service issues. Some the ladies there (90% are ladies) do not speak English clearly. So when I give my order some times I can't understand what they're saying. This led to me getting double meat on flat bread that was completely sloppy. Sometimes they don't understand very clearly stated orders.  A guy in line ordered a regular coffee. They made hazel nut. When he pointed out the issue they kept reiterating that hazel nut was in fact a regular coffee. They just didn't understand,  he took the coffee. My last visit was just annoying. I paid with a 10 dollar bill for a 8 dollar order. I got nooooooooo change other than a quarter that came out automatically from the cash register. When I brought up the fact that I didn't get my dollar bills she looked wide eyed at me pointed to the coins and said with a smile \"there\". I asked again she looked around at her family member to the side smiled at me again and shook her head. I just walked out not wanting to argue with a language barrier.\n\nSome of the good things is that one of the older ladies sometimes gives food to some of the homeless people who come in.

Was given a menu and we ask for a min.\n\nIt took us all of five minutes to decide on Mediterranean wings and a chicken flat bread and we waved the bartender down and  was sadly informed that the kitchen has closed.

She emediately apologized and comped the meal which I didn't eat... That's why they have two stars\n\nSo I left while the employees gave me the meanest faces they could make lol.. Don't worry I won't be back and bigger will anyone I know..\n\nI headed over to Ameer's Mediterranean Grill and got perfect service and great food.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f507d37759f24f:0x459b79a9c64cbcc5"}

The restaurant is open, airy and tranquil with interesting views. For locals, visiting Prime Meridian on a light downtown event weekend is an amazingly hassle free and enjoyable dining experience. You truly beat the crowds of Buckhead,  Midtown, VaHi, Inman, etc.\n\nIf you arrive after 7:30, the dinning room starts to be fun people watching with different \"stories\" at every table of travelers.

{"user_id":1.086768732e+20,"name":"April Ambi","rating":1,"text":"DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT AMERICAN DELI ON HOWELL MILL!!! This may happen to you too. I went into this location 5\/24\/17 & placed an order. Going off of the sign they had displaying their wing flavors, I made my decision. Once I got my wings I realized that the flavor I wanted was available just not displayed on the sign as an option. I asked for a small side cup to mask the flavor that was on the wing. I could have asked them to remake it but I tried to be convenient & courteous of their time & mine. The lady told me it would be an additional charge for sauce. I explained to her that if their options would have been properly displayed then I would not have chosen that flavor. Instead of saying \"ma'am I apologize but I have to charge you\" or \"ok well next time make sure you ask\" she started  raising her voice. She asked me in a condescending tone \"why did you order this if you did not want it? Did you or did you not order this?\" I explained to her again about the sign. I even picked it up & showed her. She walked off to the side, sat down & started playing on her phone. I asked for my money back & then she pretended that she didn't understand what I was saying. When I asked the woman pictured her name, she looked at me, snorted & said \"why?\" I said I'm going to speak to your manager. She looked at me laughed & went back to her phone. When I saw she wouldn't give me her name I took the picture. I came into the location 5\/25\/17 & asked to speak to the manger.  I told her that the problem was not the extra charge but the manner in which her employee spoke to me & the horrible customer service I received. She kept making excuses for her employee until I showed her this picture. I explained to her that everyone is entitled to get frustrated but it is how we deal with that frustration that makes the difference.  The manger, \"Hailey,\" offered to give me my money back. I said that would be a step in the right direction. She then refused to give me my money back & offered a replacement meal. I finally accepted it because that was the only thing she was willing to do even after she offered me my money back. When I left the store, I made a quick ig video telling my experience. It was a quiet video that had no cursing, yelling or unruly behavior. Hailey came outside placing her hands on me telling me she was trying to help me. I let her know I was just sharing with my followers my experience. I walked away, put my phone away & was heading home (I showed her where I lived & she asked me if I was sure I lived there & didn't work there). I turned around & saw her Following me like a stalker. I pulled my phone out to record how she was still harassing me. I was far away from American deli & on the property of Kroger. She asked me to delete the video & I asked her to leave me alone (still walking away). She then yelled in front of a large group of people that she was going to call the police. I turned around & asked her what she said & she saw the camera still in my hand. I explained to her & the new crowd that we now had that I had not stolen anything or done anything to her. I reminded her that I was a paying customer that received the worst service possible from her business & that I was expressing my rights to the freedom of speech & that she was harassing me by following me home. I asked her if she wanted me to call the police because she was in the wrong. I apologized that the crowd had to witness that & proceeded to walk away. I had recently saw a police but he was gone when I reached the spot that I saw him. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE!!! A situation that could have been calmly explained resulted in me having to speak to the manger who then harassed me & threatened to call the police until she realized she was in the wrong. I wish I would have called the police & reported her for following me home, demanding that I delete media off of MY phone!!!!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f504e0f64bda2f:0xe2d975121ebe9b18"}

This location is conveniently located in the Edgewood Plaza, so passing through the area or shopping, it's an awesome stop for a quick bite for lunch or dinner. Kind of between a \"fast food\" restaurant, and an actual dine in restaurant, this doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe burgers are absolutely incredible and usually very hot and fresh. They give you unlimited toppings, and they offer a variety of choices that make your burger incredibly customized and memorable. The fries are amazing as well, being freshly cut and cooked, with options for regular or Cajun. (Tip; Cajun are the best; they're seasoned to perfection) They also have a coke freestyle drink machine, and a generously large area inside the restaurant for seating and dining in. The staff can be kind of a hit or miss. At times they're friendly and welcoming, other times they just stare at you or don't say a word, but I guess they get the job done.\n\nMy only complaint would probably be the prices. Of course for a Five Guys it'll be more expensive than your average burger joint or fast food place, and the burgers are incredible! But I can't help feeling like the value isn't that great . The food is amazing, but the burgers range from 5-8, the fries 3-5, and the drinks around 2-3. So for a meal your going to spend over  10 dollars.\n\nOverall, a really awesome burger spot and semi fast food place!! Definitely recommend.

I knew it waa mostly a catering company but I was pleased to learn they actually opened a location to the public that was stationary and not mobile. Mobile catering is big here in Atlanta. Meaning they prepare food off site and then they throw up a post stating where you can pick up your food if you place an order. Pop up catering.\n\nThis location is basically three miles away but Ichose to do Uber Eats. I read nothing but great reviews so I figure why not give them a shot. I ordered the Barbecue Turkey Ribs (didn't know such a thing existed), Collard Greens flavored with Turkey meat, Sweet Potatoes. That was $14. I also ordered a side of Macaroni and Cheese $3.50.\n\nI received my food and went to eating. There was also a piece of cornbread included. Next the greens. These are real Collard Greens full of turkey meat. If you don't like meat throughout your greens choose another option. They had a nice flavor. Next the sweet potatoes. At first glance they looked canned but after I tasted them I realized they were fresh. I was a little underwhelmed by the seasoning. Not enough nutmeg but they are also out of season. Next I tried the turkey ribs. I was trying to figure out what part of the turkey had a bone like this but this is part of the breast. Very moist and tender. The macaroni and cheese looked blah but the flavor was very good. The butter ooozed out of it.\n\nAll in all it was good. I just wish caterers would take the leap and season their food more. It would be nice if cornbread was on the menu as a side option. $14 is a bit steep for the amount of food but you can take it or leave it.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f51d294b1a7345:0x17527954ca85b19a"}

I ordered a $5 Margarita, the app sampler which had some yummy mozzarella bites on it, my boyfriend ordered chicken tacos and I got the smoked half chicken with green beans and mashed potatoes; the chicken was tender but didn't have any flavor so I asked for BBQ sauce to go with it. They were out of the potatoes and mac and cheese that I wanted to sub it for and the green beans had bacon in it which would've been nice for our server Cierra to mention whether if she had known if I liked bacon or not. So I subbed for steamed broccoli and rice pilaf which had cherry tomatoes, corn, spinach and some veggie stem in it which should also be explained to your guest as well. We got seated sometime around 11p and they closed at 12a so I get it that you're working on closing out other tables and cleaning up but still check to see if certain ingredients in the food that your guest is ordering will be okay. I did like that Cierra was prompt about going back to the kitchen and getting the sides and sauces that I asked her for. Also, the gate to the parking deck was out of service so we parked across the street at the Kroger.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f505cd229b2991:0xa84e3a052e4b04fa"}

Our waitress was friendly & incredibly accommodating, INCLUDING getting a couple of monitors turned to the Tampa Bay Lightning game (Round 1 of the playoffs!). She was attentive while we scoured the menu & continually checked on us throughout our meal. My cocktail glass was never alone & empty!\n\nI ordered the Billionaire's Bacon Burger, which was quite hot (spicy), yet amazing. The bacon was so sweet, but yet so very hot... What a combination! (Also available solo as an appetizer). With my burger, I opted for a bowl of Mac n' Cheese with bacon instead of the fries. My mom chose three sides (House Made Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Sauteed Vegetables, & Mac n' Cheese) as her meal, and had trouble finishing because the portions were so huge & delicious. My sister had the Blackened Fish Tacos with Mac n' Cheese (sans bacon), and raved about how good those fish tacos were. She & I both agreed that our cocktails were strong & yummy, too. Interestingly, we noticed a large digital temperature slightly fluctuating on the wall near the bar... after asking our waitress, we were impressed to learn its connected to the beer cooler! You'll always know exactly how cold the beer is!\n\nHaving never watched Twin Peaks in the 90's, I didn't understand any decor connections, if any existed, but you'll get the \"Twin Peaks\" reference after seeing the waitresses' uniforms.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f505cd229b2991:0xa84e3a052e4b04fa"}

Buy the time I got there at around 12:35pm the place was packed and we were placed on a waiting list for a table. We never sat at the table not because we didn\u2019t want to but mainly because it never died down it only got more packed. We managed to find a seat at the bar and that was good enough to get a great viewpoint of all the TVs. This place was great it was a woman\u2019s dream with all the beautiful men, and a man\u2019s fantasy because of all the scantily clothed servers as well as the women patrons also.

My confusion must have been visible because she went on to explain that I could have a big, manly beer or a small mug. Feeling pressured to prove my masculinity I ordered a small beer and received 10 oz of beer in a frosty mug at a price of $4.75.\nThe selection of local and craft beers was shamefully small and prices rather high, besides serving artisanal beer in a frosted mug does not showcase their understanding of flavor development and beer.

{"user_id":1.07434909e+20,"name":"Stocks Huskies (Stocks and Huskies)","rating":2,"text":"Went here 6\/5\/2014.\n\nWomen walking around half-naked. Check. Better than Hooters by a long shot.\n\nFood?  Eh, could be better. For the portions you get, prices are on the expensive side.  I found myself asking for multiple orders of food in order to even have the food 'register'.  Don't share the appetizers ... because that is just crazy for a dish that is really for one person.  The things we ordered are rated below, five stars being great:\n\n- Wings, ***, pretty standard taste and smaller than some places in the area for the price.\n\n- Mozzarella balls, ***, crispy outside, salty inside, yet cheesy even when cold.\n\n- Chips and Cheese Dip, **, chips are thin and extremely salty and dip was sufficiently dense enough to break every other thin chip.\n\n- Chicken Quesadillas,  , I don't know what the heck these things were supposed to be.  The little chicken that was in the slices was DRENCHED in cheese to the point they were inedible ... I usually can eat 2 plates of these things wherever and whenever I order them.  This was a disgrace;  if they can't make them right, then they need to take them off the menu.\n\nDon't order the watered down drinks. I actually received a 'manager's special' (basically asked them to bring me anything with vodka in it to test them) and I decided that ended up being a watered down mess ... ordered beers in a bottle from there on out.  They also can't make any 'special drinks', per their own words, because they are trying to use the same women who are supposed to be eye candy as bartenders to cash grab instead of hiring actual bartenders.  I was upstairs so maybe downstairs they could do something like a Blue Motorcycle, I wouldn't know.  I don't ask more than once for something; I just add it into the review.\n\nOur waitress really needs to learn how to get better tips.  We were the only table she was waiting on that was ordering food and drinks.  Good waitresses know to make sure to keep the tables supplied that are ordering things ... not ours.  She was basically ignoring our table.  I told 1 of the 3 other people who were supposed to come though about the service; they decided they'd go somewhere else.  Since they weren't coming through, I stopped ordering, asked for the check and left.  She basically turned the whole experience negative for my night.\n\nThe highlight of the place are the big windows upstairs, which we were sitting next to inside.  The atmosphere was pretty good. ... until it started raining outside.  And, of course, after it started raining, the electronic shutters didn't work.  So people by our huge window, and by another window which malfunctioned, started to get soaked.  Good times ... but the upstairs is nice and screened in when it is sunny and the view is great.\n\nOn a side note, you might wanna tell them to turn off the fans when the temp drops.  I wasn't sure why I needed to say something about that to the supervisor, but, just so you know, you might have to actually tell them to stop the 'tropical' vibe.\n\nSpeaking of talking to a manager, I told one of the issues - especially concentrating on our service.  I got a 'We appreciate the feedback' and an Obama fistbump ... I tried my best to entertain this sly attempt to brush my concerns aside.  So, basically, they need to keep their 'talent' happy because your dollars are fleeting and temporary; they need the women with the skinny midriffs.\n\nSo, all in all, my review is that there are good-looking women at the nicely decorated Twin Peaks, but that doesn't overcome the fact you're paying a pretty good penny for what you actually came to this bar and grill for: mediocre food and beer.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f505cd229b2991:0xa84e3a052e4b04fa"}

{"user_id":1.143851807e+20,"name":"Kristin Journigan","rating":1,"text":"I met up with 4 friends who were there to watch the Falcons-Panthers game (Sunday, 10-2-2016). They were on a text waiting list for a table inside, so they were sitting on the patio in the last section. They got there at noon for a table but did not get a text saying there was an available table for 4 until 4pm.\n\nService from the waitresses: awful, subpar\n\nFood taste\/quality: mediocre, sufficient, tastes like everything is fried in the same grease (the chicken strips and fish). My burger and sweet potato fries were both served to me cold, so no telling how long my food had been sitting waiting to be delivered.\n\nThe Twin Peaks girls (waitresses) only want to take orders and collect tips. They are super slow to bring your food and drink orders but blamed everything on the bar,  didn't want to buss their own tables, remove trash and empty glasses off the tables, nothing. My friend had to continuously ask for a Red Bull from the waitress (Kasey? Kassie? Looks mixed, long curly hair or weave) and she finally brought it to her after an hour. I had to ask 3 times for a bottled water, then wait another 20 minutes for a straw. The waitress sat down 2 or 3 times saying she was tired. But meanwhile, I had accidentally knocked over a shot glass and it shattered on the ground. I told the waitress Kasey\/Cassie\/Kelsy 5 times but she never cleaned it up nor sent anyone else to clean it up. We had 27 empty glasses were we were sitting (both beer mugs & shot glasses) and not once did she take any away. Finally a busboy came and cleared some of them. But didn't get up the broken glass. But Kasey went to go get our check though, ran the card, brought it back and sat back down telling us how she closed the night before and didn't get off until 2am, then had to be back this morning to open and was now getting off at 4pm. That's your job, along with cleaning away empty dishes! $272 tab, plus a $60 tip from the person who paid, and she still didn't clean up the broken glasses, extra glass, nor my empty water bottles.\n\nSince we were still waiting on a table, a new waitress named Anna (white, blonde chin length hair)  came to serve us. Anna didn't pick up any extra glasses either. I asked Anna to clean up the broken glass and told her we asked the last waitress 4 times to clean  it up, but she didn't. Anna said, \"I'll send a busser.\" I understand that establishments like that have busboys that they are mandatory to tip out, but as a waitress you should still help clean up too.

{"user_id":1.143851807e+20,"name":"Kristin Journigan","rating":1,"text":"I met up with 4 friends who were there to watch the Falcons-Panthers game (Sunday, 10-2-2016). They were on a text waiting list for a table inside, so they were sitting on the patio in the last section. They got there at noon for a table but did not get a text saying there was an available table for 4 until 4pm.\n\nService from the waitresses: awful, subpar\n\nFood taste\/quality: mediocre, sufficient, tastes like everything is fried in the same grease (the chicken strips and fish). My burger and sweet potato fries were both served to me cold, so no telling how long my food had been sitting waiting to be delivered.\n\nThe Twin Peaks girls (waitresses) only want to take orders and collect tips. They are super slow to bring your food and drink orders but blamed everything on the bar,  didn't want to buss their own tables, remove trash and empty glasses off the tables, nothing. My friend had to continuously ask for a Red Bull from the waitress (Kasey? Kassie? Looks mixed, long curly hair or weave) and she finally brought it to her after an hour. I had to ask 3 times for a bottled water, then wait another 20 minutes for a straw. The waitress sat down 2 or 3 times saying she was tired. But meanwhile, I had accidentally knocked over a shot glass and it shattered on the ground. I told the waitress Kasey\/Cassie\/Kelsy 5 times but she never cleaned it up nor sent anyone else to clean it up. We had 27 empty glasses were we were sitting (both beer mugs & shot glasses) and not once did she take any away. Finally a busboy came and cleared some of them. But didn't get up the broken glass. But Kasey went to go get our check though, ran the card, brought it back and sat back down telling us how she closed the night before and didn't get off until 2am, then had to be back this morning to open and was now getting off at 4pm. That's your job, along with cleaning away empty dishes! $272 tab, plus a $60 tip from the person who paid, and she still didn't clean up the broken glasses, extra glass, nor my empty water bottles.\n\nSince we were still waiting on a table, a new waitress named Anna (white, blonde chin length hair)  came to serve us. Anna didn't pick up any extra glasses either. I asked Anna to clean up the broken glass and told her we asked the last waitress 4 times to clean  it up, but she didn't. Anna said, \"I'll send a busser.\" I understand that establishments like that have busboys that they are mandatory to tip out, but as a waitress you should still help clean up too. I ended up having to ask Anna twice more before she finally picked up the big pieces and then the busser came to sweep up the rest.\n\nI had 4 or 5 empty bottles of water next to me and asked Anna for another bottled water. She looked at me and said, \"You know those aren't free, right? They cost two dollars-\" \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude36\ud83d\ude31 I said, \"Why would I think that bottle down after isn't free?

I said it!\n\nI arrived late to the birthday party that I was here for, so I'm not sure about the hosting staff but the waitress we has was really attentive and quick with ringing out drinks and dishes.  For me to be an hour ate my food arrived within minutes of everyone else.\n\nI used the Yelp check-in to score a free chips and queso order.  This cheese dip is so good.  It's not really anything super special but there is the perfect combination of queso and salsa.  There is a slight element of spice and it is topped with a scoop of chili.  I totally could of had this as my main dish and been ok with life.  I must go back!  For the main course I ordered the chicken\/shrimp basket.  Which provided a very nice portion of shrimp, chicken tenders and fries.  I liked the shrimp more than the chicken.  The fries were pretty good too.  Needless to say I took queso, chips, chicken and fries home.  :)  There were great drink prices and the shots are cheap.\n\nI love the atmosphere, from the upstairs bar.  For the location you always expect a few yuppies but all of the patrons were very down-to-earth and just there to have a good time.  The UFC fights had us all high-fiving each other.

We sat in the upstairs area, though I did see a sunken downstairs area with bocce ball. I don't like beer but found a tasty cocktail that wasn't even that expensive, which is great. The food was very good too--I liked the BBQ tater tots, which were very crispy and tasty. A friend had awesome poutine with sweet potato fries. The server we had was great and accommodating of our needs, especially when a birthday cake was brought out later on in the night. Plus, parking is pretty easy for a place in this area.

My husband really likes the games they have available (oversized jenga, for instance), and I really appreciate the food variety and all the space available.\n\nThis is a great place for large groups because of the games and free parking.  My company had its holiday party here in the downstairs area.  There were about 13 of us, and we had a great time.\n\nMy favorite meal here so far is the burger and fries.  The kale salad is quite sweet (too sweet for me) and the forbidden rice doesn't have enough flavor.  The tater tots and Korean wings are good.\n\nOne of the best things about Torched Hop is the free parking.  It's available in the Camden parking garage on Penn Ave at 265 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Atlanta, GA 30308.  The garage is a short walk to the Torched Hop entrance.\n\nIf you're looking for an upbeat place to hang with friends, Torched Hop has all you need for a good time!","resp":{"time":1558724801680,"text":"Thanks for the informative review, Lindsay.

First is, one of the bartenders (short white guy just for reference, Bruce or something close was his name) spends more time flirting with the girls then servicing the rest of the bar. If it wasn't for the other bartenders, the service at the bar would absolutely suck. Also overheard him telling a couple of patrons to give high ratings after what appeared he gave them a free shot. He also has a bit of a Napoleon complex but that's to be expected I suppose. Second, dinner service is a little slow.

The decor on the inside is very creative and it\u2019s clear that there was a lot of thought put into the atmosphere. My favorite aspect was the neon lights that were either quotes or catchy terms. That was a nice touch! The staff was very friendly. The cocktails were great and so was the hookah. The dance floor upstairs was rather small because of the VIP seating, but it wasn\u2019t a deal breaker. Because it\u2019s a lounge, I would recommend more seating. Maybe 2 person high-top tables and chairs along the walls. I\u2019d said it\u2019s a must-visit venue, though. I really appreciate the hospitality provided by promoter Jamaal Terrance and Micah Dixon. Great production.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f5037881ee3e1f:0x563ab4312f0987e0"}

I reserved a section with a promoter a month in advance which was no where to be found the night of my birthday. The female manager did not follow the advertisement on the flyer. I reserved a section for $200 that included champagne and Dusse. Since I only drink Crown Apple I inquired how much of a difference if I traded BOTH the advertised bottles for 1 bottle of Crown... She charged me $270. So that was $70 extra to trade 2 bottles for 1. Got up to the top floor where the sections are. The place is either get a section or stand. Well the female manager made my party of 15 sit in a 4 seater couch section. We terribly squished but we made it work. The flyer said $25 hookahs... the manager stated that the FIRST hookah is $25 and every hookah after that is $45. WAY OVERPRICED!!! I wanted to buy another bottle of Crown and she wanted to charge me another $270! The bottle cost $45 (if that) in the store... Thats a $225 CAP! No mam!!! So my friends bought shots for the rest of the night! Then WATCH OUT for parking! We got booted and we parked in the lot next to the building. No one was waiting at the entrance of the parking lot to state it was a charge... Overall I enjoyed my party because I decided to enjoy my party.

I returned to the store today to make a purchase using the rewards on my account but was told that I didn\u2019t have any and whoever set up my acct put me on auto enrollment so my points were redeeming and expiring without my knowledge. Called customer service from the store & was told she could only give me back $10 of what was lost. I returned the items back to the store and the agent who was very indifferent asked me if I could come back when S\/one else was there bc he didn\u2019t know how to process a return. The nerve to ask a customer to come back a different day bc he can\u2019t do his job. Did he really think I was going to leave and waste my time and gas coming back. The nerve.

Nicely done. Fairly echoey, though, and with the background music turned up a good bit, it was a little difficult to have a conversation. Our server was prompt and polite. The food came came out relatively quickly. We all enjoyed our orders very much. I had the chorizo torta and a taco al Pastor. One of my friends ordered the Cuban torta but had to ask to have pickles added. Typically a Cuban sandwich comes with pickles so we were a little surprised. We were really surprised when the server said they'd have to charge 40 cents for the pickles. Pickles are a common condiment that should be free. But I can honestly say the food was outstanding. The menu has a lot of great choices, but I feel it is a little more pricey than some other taco and torta restaurants. I'm posting photos of my order so you can see just how great the presentation is. I definitely recommend Taco Cantina O4W for the quality of the food and the attentive service, but I do feel it's a tad noisy and a little pricey.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f5040a3906e05f:0x5107d50a6a18305c"}

The reason is to make the right broth needs 48-72 hours work. Hiro makes excellent broth, delicate and with pleasant flavor. The noodles also have right texture and delicious. I'm very happy that Hiro opened in my neighborhood. I'll definitely go back.","resp":{"time":1620876580445,"text":"Thank you for leaving us a rating of your experience at our business.

I understand that deep dish pizzas take longer to cook, but expect a minimum of 45 minutes to receive your pizza after ordering.\n\nThere is a pseudo-wait staff.  You order and pay at the counter and get your cup and fill your own Pepsi products, but then this wait staff will bring you your pizza and clean off the table when you leave.  I'm not a fan of this halfway service, either make it full waitstaff or do away with them completely.\n\nThey often have karaoke or professional musicians in the restaurant so later in the evening it can be loud.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f5058cbd7bc9a1:0xbed01d9a0442fe9f"}

Sadly, it was not.  I realize they are trying to make menu items that are quicker to produce to appeal to the in-a-hurry lunch crowd but I don't think it has to be this cut down.  So, you have like 5 sauces to choose from, 5 pastas, and only one type of salad (none of my Figo favorites).  I chose a sauce and they were out of that sauce--it was only noon.  You ran out in 30 minutes?  The salad was hot and bland and so was the dressing.  The pasta was okay, but not enough to bring me back.  Customer service was robotic...thing that struck me as the biggest waste was you order by checking your choices on a sheet and handing it to the cashier.  Are your employees not capable of taking the order like normal people?  Do you know how much paper this wastes uselessly?  It didn't save time (cashier was slow to find the appropriate register buttons anyway).  My lunch was $16--worth it for sit down Figo, not worth this.  Ill-conceived concept.

They also don't do mobile ordering, instead being with this Tapingo service, which I assume paid GA Tech lots of money to be the sole provider of mobile ordering on campus. No Starbucks rewards program either.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f504685b3f09c5:0x93288a44662551b2"}

The line is always long here, does not matter what time you decide to come.  The service is horrendous, baristas here do not care about your order, how much milk you want or not, or any for that matter.  They will talk amongst themselves while attempting to take orders, and naturally keep people waiting and mess up orders, or just decide to ignore customers and walk away leaving the register unmanned.  The coffee here is always going to be old--that is because college students do not drink coffee!  They take shots of espresso in their lattes and other crazy drinks that are on the menu.  So your basic Pike's roast has literally been sitting there all day, on the warmer, most likely brewed poorly to begin with.  So do not order a plain black coffee from here.  Also, this location does not participate in the future order system provided by the Starbucks App on your phone, instead you have to use another app, but you can still use your Starbucks App to pay for your drink.  Piece of advice, there are multiple other coffee shops around the campus area that provide better service, greater quality coffee, and there is almost never a line.

That third star is for the drinks, but I also feel they can get pretty expensive.\n\nThe last time there, I got there on a Friday after work and was completely shocked by two things.  The patio, although open, the windows between the patio and the bar were closed. A nice warm evening in Atlanta and the windows are closed??? Until when? Oh when you get more people? That seems silly and takes away from patio\/bar sitting experience for those that don't get there at 7pm.. The second shock was the nice little sign on the table that stated \"Please enjoy this table for two hours ~ $75\/per hour minimum for each additional hour.\"  I'm sorry, but where am I, and what restaurant charges for ADDITIONAL HOURS??? The waitress claims people come and hang out without ordering anything. Ok, then kindly advise THOSE people you need the table for paying customers. But to put out signs like that? I was appalled and just disappointment in the way Strip chose to handle the situation. Maybe its me.\n\nStrip for food is ok. We go for sushi, but as I eat sushi in other places, Strip reminds me I just go there for the location and patio. They used to have a half price special on sushi on Thursdays but that been gone for some time.  Now it seems overpriced. The lobster roll, is the same price as a rainbow roll and they kind of just taste the same.  I have ordered other items but nothing really sticks out to me to be able to write about it.\n\nI do like the fact that there are two bars, one upstairs and downstairs. The bartenders are usually attentive and friendly so its good for drinks. But again pricey drinks. The have added some craft beers to their menu but they charge $8.75 for Golden Victory Monkey and i know that is an inflated price compared to other restaurants. Strip i what you make of it some bring some fun folks with you and don't sit on the patio for longer than two hours.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f50457fe197e8b:0xc9c1b06e8cb7d39d"}

We told the waitress this was not the agreement and her only explanation was, \"Yes I may have said that, but you guys must-have misunderstood me.\"\nSo we basically were forced to pay this bill and wasn't able to leave.

She was seating people for the front outside deck . The waitress was extremely rude and had unattended tables where we were. She sat us outside on the front deck and never said once that this area was reserved for people spending large amounts of money. She came over after one hour and says. I am going to need to move you guys to my friend in a rude manner. When asked why she had no answer and vanished for 45 more minutes. She came later and sat two guys down that she was friends with near our table. My friend proceeded to go to the bathroom and the waitress came back while she wasn't there and said I told yall to move. I proceeded to ask her who she was speaking to and then she vanished again and came back with a man who looked like another waiter and he was like we need this table because there are people spending 500.00 dollars or more that need our table. I guess the 40.00 we spent on the hookah plus the food that was ordered for a close to 100.00 ticket was not good enough not including the tip we gave the waitress for not being there. Bottom line is this, they service you based on the amount of money you spend there and this young lady represents the type of service you will get when you spend certain amounts. I will not recommend this place based on service. The men that busted the table cared more because we had to use them to grab her attention everytime . If you are  in Buckhead or anywhere else, please do not have waitresses with with low vibrational energy serving your customers because it is a reflection of your business. She definitely is not a asset to your business or essential to your establishment.

Not too long, so we looked over the dinner list to decide what we would try first.\nNot long after, we were seated. Our table had a salad, pickled radishes, and sauce already on it. Our waitress brought out a clean grate to place over the fire she had just started. She let us know we can order 3 meats at a time and choose different ones as we go along.\nWe tried several. The best of the ones we tried was the iron age steak. It was delicious and so soft!  We also loved the teriyaki marinated beef and the shrimp. Least favorite and one we couldn't eat was the garlic pork.\nWe tried the shrimp, it was pretty good.\nThe rice cakes were delicious. It seemed like they are fried or something because they have a slight crunch on the outside but soft inside. The red sauce on them is delicious.\nThe seasoned radish sticks were so good. Slightly sour and sweet.\nThe salad had an really good dressing on it. Sweet but spicy.\nThe clear noodles were interesting. I can't describe the texture very well, like gummy noodles? Anyways, they had sliced peppers and a seasoning on top that made them tasty.\nI'm sure there are other items on the list that are delicious but we were stuffed due to ordering the iron age steak twice.\nIt was a really good experience and we'd like to visit again and try other items..and the iron age steak!\n\nThe music is loud but not to the point of interfering with service.\n\n$27 dinner menu per person.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f5074c1df643ab:0x21d6c679e0424dc7"}

The food quality was not good and the spaghetti my daughter ordered looked like it was swimming in water. My minestrone soup was tasteless.  Calamari is overly breaded though the menu says \u201clightly\u201d.  Best thing was the Caesar salad.  Wine list is poor and something was floating in my first glass of wine. They rectified this immediately by pouring the second glass in front of me.  It\u2019s really pricey for the quality of the food. Not sure why the high marks for the restaurant but it could be the older crowd who are not foodies.  Sadly we would not return but I can tell they have a regular crowd.

Secondly, the house wine (both red and white) are just terrible.  Lastly, the service was minimal at best.  The waiter didn't do anything, say any specials, recommend anything, ask how our meal was.

The steak was cooked to perfection and the gorgonzola whipped potatoes were amazing. My pasta is exactly what bolognese is supposed to be. The flavors were on point. The entrees alone were worth 5 stars. Unfortunately 5 stars is the max rating I can give the dessert. Jay had an apple cheescake on the menu, so it was a must try. I've had many of his cheescakes before and each rendition have been impeccable but this left them all behind. The flavors were prominent and balanced.

While standing in line I saw the jumbo dog and the kids meal with a hot dog was the same price. So I get to the window and ask a SIMPLE question with no attitude. She gives me this funky A-- response with her eyes fully open with attitude. Hopefully she is able to read this and understand you do not always get something because it is a better price\/deal. Sometimes you get what you need because you are not going to use the other nor can you resell, that is considered intentional waste.\n\n1. I did not need or want fries or drink for my two boys. We already had 4 drinks and I was not trying to carry any more. They were not going to eat the fries soooo...what is the point of wasting...\n\n2. I asked the question because I figured the kids meal had a smaller hot dog and I was going to see if they probably sold that separately off menu than the jumbo. Doing that would have kept me from throwing away fries and not drinking the drinks.\n\nShe then turns to the lady behind her and says something smart about my decision. The other lady says I would have gotten the kids meal. I said not if your are going to waste the other food :). Some people are just too focused and do not look at the whole picture. They probably still will not understand my reasoning but hey :)...after getting home I thought I could have gotten the kids meal and just gave the fries and drink to a homeless person. Now I would have respected them saying that then just telling me to get the kids meal.

I am currently drinking coffees from Brazil, Ethiopia and Guatemala, and they all have very different profiles from more traditional to more expressive.  They also regularly brew new batch brew every hour or so, and manual brew using a Clever+Gabi, so this is a place that takes its coffee seriously.  Its also great that they take the pandemic seriously, with mask wearing and half a dozen outdoor tables with Wi-Fi available.

It's a chain from Savannah and this is the first one in Atlanta. I'd had the beans before at petit chou, and they were great so I was excited to try out the freestanding shop. I got a \"wild\" espresso, and a salmon toast. The espresso was rich and had some cranberry and but nutmeg notes on the nose. The salmon toast had a bunch of greenery that I took off, but it had crunchy red onions, and much more lox than you normally get for $12. Seriously that is always a problem at delis and bagel shops, skimping on salmon and charging out the wazoo for it! Not PERC, it was a substantial amount of fish for a fair price. Will definitely be going back! There's always a line, so it's obviously popular, but they still get you your other quite quick.

However, their wings and family atmosphere are that good. I've attached a picture of my wings from when we were there a couple of days ago.

Upon my return, I asked about my order; she said \"Oh I looked for you!\" I figured my paid-in-advance order was ready. WRONG! She waited on,  and completed orders for, at least 5 more customers, one with a food order, others that required using the blender. Once the cafe was empty, she went in back and, due to the amount of  time it took her to return, I assume she finally started and finished my order! My coffee is now cold; no offer for a refill, not even an apology. A sole employee should prioritize orders, even if others have to wait. If Cafe Lucia feels this is not appropriate, then they should remove\nfood items that take longer to prepare. Better yet, hire another employee!!

Full disclosure--I've been to Saba in Emory Village (same owners) when it was open and left totally underwhelmed. Paolino is ten times better and the location in Oakhurst is great, too.\n\nI walked over to the restaurant to pick my food up, and I was thrilled to see all of the COVID precautions they are taking for to-go. The staff places your order in a tamper resistant bag and then places the bag into a cubby with your name on it. When you get to the restaurant, they have gloves to open the cubby, you grab your bag and head out. Super easy and no contact with the staff is needed.\n\nI got chicken parm and garlic bread and both delivered. The chicken itself was soft, the sauce robust, and it seemed like they use a few different types of cheese so you don't get the same one-note cheese flavor. My only complaint is that the portion was a little small for $16. The pasta under the chicken was good and garlic bread was excellent, although it's pretty hard to mess up garlic bread.\n\nLooking forward to returning and sampling some more of the menu!","resp":{"time":1615925390250,"text":"Thank you!"},"gmap_id":"0x88f50754fc3b4565:0x364cb8abf3b79275"}

I had to repeat that I just found out after him already eating some of it and I just wanted to have something to offer my boss for his next lunch (honestly he would have been happy with a $2 or 1 off), this manager told me he can only apologize, change out sandwiches and also told me I should have opened and checked the sandwich before allowing him to eat. So not only was his logic disrespectful but also flawed in the fact that the cost of replacing the sandwich plus time of employee delivering would cost more than a simple coupon. I reminded him he needed to also find out which employee actually made the sandwich and overlooked the receipt, to ensure they are trained correctly. At this point in the conversation, I can only assume by his lack of enunciation, this was not the manager but the actual person who made the sandwich incorrectly. We will no longer order from here and will pass on the lack of customer service and respect by this location to everyone in this building.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f5044ffdaa0195:0x1b03da071e875f6"}

Driving to this neighborhood was... interesting to say the least. The closer we got to the place, the more I wanted to turn back, because I like my car and I'd prefer to continue to have something to like about it.\n\nJokes aside, we got there, and inside was a whole other world. The area around Pizzeria Vesuvius is shady and dark and it is not a great idea to come at night, but inside it's warm and welcoming and has a friendly atmosphere with the smell of pizza wafting through the air. As you walk in, you see a pizza dough on your right probably in the air, or a pizza about to go into the oven. Our particular waiter was very nice and seemed pretty informed about the pizzas and he was polite and quick with everything including all our refills and getting us plates.\n\nThe food, however, is where I was a bit disappointed. The pizza we got was honestly pretty bland, albeit pretty spicy (we got the buffalo chicken pizza). That's my only real qualm, since if the pizza wasn't sub-par this place would definitely be above average.\n\nStill, I've heard a lot of good things about this place so I'm ready to come back again and really see what it's like with a more complex dish because this first time I came it definitely didn't live up to expectations.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f50386f48cb1e1:0xc0b5ddea568ace65"}

The decor is a beautiful southern ode to the owner's grandmother and her recipes (the owner is also the proprietor of CamiCakes). It's cute and quaint and when you hear \"Annie Mae's Pantry\" you just know it's going to be some good ol' down-home food prepared by M'dear or MawMaw or Big Mama but the food was... underwhelming. A lot underwhelming. I will preface this by the fact that I went during their grand opening so there was a free tasting, which I appreciated.  Because they were cooking for a large number of tasters at once,  I'm just going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say maybe they rushed the food or decided to do no frills because we weren't paying customers... but it was all just blah. I went with a few friends and we all sampled a different dish. The grits for the shrimp & grits \/ fish & grits were clearly just grits and water.  No salt. No butter.  No cream. Instant grits and water. The fish tasted as if it were dipped in generic breading and fried. I couldn't really taste any seasonings. The shrimp & grits were on the watery side. It tasted as if the sausage drippings were rendered and they threw in a few veggies and shrimp, but again, I couldn't taste any distinct seasonings other than the sausage drippings. My other friend had the brisket grilled cheese sandwich and she said all she could taste was gristle\/fat  and cheese. Their Vanilla Bean tea was something I'd never experienced and was definitely tasty. Their desserts were a homerun. Considering this is the owner of CamiCakes, I was half-way expecting the desserts to taste like the cupcakes which are hit or miss (to me) -- but I can absolutely say these didn't taste like the cupcakes. They tasted like very fresh & moist cakes with a yummy frosting.  I know this sounds like a \"diss\" post. This is certainly not my aim  because I reaalllly wanted to like it but I think it's important to give honest and unbiased feedback. It's black owned and it boasts of southern cuisine and for those reasons alone I was excited for this restaurant, but it really fell flat in the food department. I will definitely give it another try as a paying customer and see if my experience differs. If that is the case, I will eat humble pie and edit my review HOPING that the night I went was just an off night.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f504e319c6076d:0x7ca99746cb36a5da"}

We went here on a Saturday afternoon. It was a warm day with great weather and I needed a nice spot to catch up with my friend. This location used to be called My Fair Sweets another black owned business....which was like a dessert\/coffee shop. They moved downtown on Mitchell Street.\n\nI arrived early for my lunch date so I sat outside. They have a couple of bistro tables set up in front of the store. When my friend arrived we went inside. I love the set up and design of the place. Its very cute. They have more tables sprinkled through the place. Its not a huge establishment but they make it work. My favorite is the rocking chairs and the huge farm table and the murals. They are awesome.\n\nWe had to take our time and figure out what we wanted to eat that day. I decided to get the Catfish and Grits. So so good. I love the fact that they put spinach in the the cheese\/cream sauce. The fish itself was melt in your mouth good and seasoned so very well. I also ordered a baked sweet potato. Delicious!!! The vanilla lemonade...Yum. Of course I couldn't leave without ordering a piece of cake. Sweet Potato Cake. My God. Delicious\n\nThe only issues I have with Annie Mae's Pantry is that the staff is slow and confused at times as to what they should be doing and when they should be doing it. It seems like everyone does everything which leaves them in a confused state as to who is attending who. We had to wait a very long time for our food as did other patrons. Some patrons were not so happy about that. I give everyone a shot so I was prepared to do some waiting. The owner was there that day. I follow Andra Hall on Instagram for her other establishment CamiCakes. She sat next to me at the big table but she was busy talking to her family\/friends and making it happen in the kitchen.\n\nThe place also can get very smoky. They need more ventilation.

I ordered take-out via their online ordering system - and was told to be at the restaurant for pickup at a certain time. When I got to the restaurant, there was no host to greet, or ask where the food pick up was. I was able to look around and see the area in the back where it looked like food was prepared and packaged. My order was ready - in two packages, but I was only handed one, and had to return to the restaurant when I realised that I did not have all my food.\nThe food itself was OK - I ordered the Rasta pasta, a veggie plate with mac n cheese, black eyed peas and collard greens as well as the friend oyster mushrooms. The pasta was very tasty, the veggies on the veggie plate were salty, and the fried oysters were ok. I was most disappointed by the portion size. For the price of these items, I would have expected a bit more, but with the veggies being as over salted as they were it was probably for the best.\nNot sure if a dine-in experience would have been better, but I am willing to try again once it is safer","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f50310002b7e11:0x8d2153234853503c"}

Too much pasta not enough konjac. Other issue i tried Zucchini fries wayyyy too much breading started crumbling so I peeled it off just a suggestion leave the skin on Zucchini and pan sear with no breading will be much better or if you gonna use breading not a lot.  Also the Rastaa pasta was a lil dry so I asked for more of the cream sauce the girl said $1 for a mini cup that you put ketchup in. My suggestion give at least two sauce for that huge pasta then charge extra it's $16 give customers their money worth. I am real serious about customer service it was very minimal for me especially cashier and some guy who had his pants down with weapon showing that's not acceptable to customers be more presentable it's a business establishment.  The waitress was very helpful and we wasn't eating in. The cashier said our wait would be 20 minutes and it was almost an hour. 1st off be upfront with your customers be honest.

My husband ordered the Nashville sandwich and zucchini fries with a lavender cupcake. I had the Bob Marley wrap with Mac and cheese. The sandwich was bland and didn\u2019t resemble Nashville hot chicken in our opinions. The zucchini fries were soft and greasy and were bland as well. The Bob Marley wrap was so unpleasant. I became sick to my stomach because the jack fruit was more slimy than I\u2019ve tasted in the past. The quinoa was bland and I am just not happy. The Mac and cheese was bland.

I don\u2019t even want to elaborate on some other items but it was not good. Very pricy and not worth it. Their menu does not say there is an up charge for Mac and cheese as a side. The waitress said the owners have to put it in the new menu. We found this out after receiving the bill. They were out of oyster mushrooms but the waitress did not tell us that. The dish ( Nashville sandwich) was horrible due to them using regular mushrooms and using loaf bread even though the menu says Texas toast.what you see in the picture is exactly how the plate looked!

Please open on time, if you see a line of 20+ people at your food truck and it\u2019s past open time, it\u2019s really on you. I see that y\u2019all are hard working people but think about your patrons who are standing outside in the sun for hours to buy your food. You can try to make it easier on them, not open 20 minutes past open time. Also, please try to post on social media when you are not gonna have certain items on your menu. You post on social media all the time, so just give people a heads up that there\u2019s not gonna be poboys or wing basket. Finally, if possible, can the beignets be fried separately?They were good, but I suspect they are being fried on the same grease as the meat or shrimp or something.

I had been to Amer (the bar in this spot before) and was eager to give this place a shot.\n\nThe cocktails menu is fantastic -- the drinks are on the chalkboard behind the bar and there is a good variety, several riffs on classic cocktails as well as new creations. I really enjoyed the That's Bananas, a frozen drink made with Aged Rum, Bananas, Lime, Orgeat, and Curacao. There were 8 of us in my party and each of us ordered something different and there wasn't a single complaint. Another one that stood out was the All Ryes on Me, a fantastic coffee-Boulevardier. This place knows their stuff and has a good selection of spirits to play with. The bartender told us the menu would change seasonally.\n\nI really enjoyed the setup of this place: instead of table service, you order at the bar and then find a place to sit or stand. My biggest complaint with the previous bar here (Amer) was that it was easy to get overlooked in the back corner -- obviously not a problem any longer. There is a long bench in the back room and lots of standing bar areas to rest your drink. The place got busy while we were there (9:30PM) but it still felt like there were plenty of spots to stand and talk with groups or sit and have a conversation.\n\nI had eaten a large meal before coming so I did not order any food. I did notice that they had hot dogs on the menu, reminding me of PDT in NYC.\n\nI will definitely be back here -- it's the right balance of sophisticated drinks and a laid-back atmosphere. It's dimly lit, with candles throughout, and it feels like it would be a great spot to bring a date or to enjoy with a big group.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f5059515bb6e27:0xb173b186a125bb95"}

I love the outside courtyard. With the strung lights and exposed brick, it's the perfect space to spend long summer nights chatting over food and drink with friends. It's the perfect event space.\n\nI went in to see the space during the day as I was considering it as a non-coffeehouse spot to get some work done. A couple months later, I returned with friends during a themed \"Japanese Urban\" night. A few things were off that night - besides the one lady walking around in a kimono and some leftover Japanese candy from H-Mart on the tables, I didn't get a feel for the theme. But you can see that they tried. The music was good. There weren't a lot of people there and the lights were a little bright for that hour.\n\nThe bar? They need to build it up. Wines and other drink selections are pretty limited.\n\nThe food? We got there later in the evening so we only tried dessert and drinks. The \"Festival\" dessert dish of cornmeal donuts with a buttered rum sauce? Yep... those were really, really good. Definitely a dish to be shared but deliciously so. My friend also ordered the yuca fries. They were not bad - better than most I've tried.\n\nI hope Studio No. 7 makes it. The space is awesome and they host some fun evenings with different types of music, trivia and theme nights to keep it fresh.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: Parking (directly across the street) is limited but that's to be expected in that part of downtown Atlanta.

Date & Time: Monday at 5:18\nIt has a modern feel as you walk in. I get the feeling that the main location for the chain is the west coast. I get a California vibe from it. When you go to order the menu is bright and somewhat easy to read. Their menu has quite a few items on it ranging from hot dogs, burgers, and custard. I ordered an signature burger minus the lettuce and I added pickles. Once you order they give you a pager. The wait was about five mins. The food looked ok and they have a brand that they use on the top buns of the burger. I personally don't know why they do this. Maybe so you don't forget where you got the food from. I started to eat the burger and it was just a burger. Nothing special. I was hoping that their signature sauce would add some element to the burger but it didn't.\nFinal notes: Clean place, big menu, ok hamburgers.\nI would eat there again just not sure if they are worth the price.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f5065f51904595:0x8b46114decea3ca6"}

The original restaurant we were to choose was closed so we decided to try Rosa Mexicano. It was the best decision we could have made. We truly enjoyed ourselves. We ordered the tableside guacamole and the gentleman was prompt and helpful and his guacamole was delicious. As a matter of fact we ordered two of them because we went through the first one so quickly. My friend ordered the queso fundido and while she didn't eat it because it wasn't the normal queso dip she's used to it arrived at the table prompt and hot and it looked delicious. After much girl talk it was time for us to order our entrees and one order the enchiladas one order the quesadilla and me and the other friend ordered the grilled wild shrimp which was fabulous. When the entrees came to the table one of my girlfriends remark or I'm going to take that home because I know I'm not going to be able to eat it all well when she got going on the enchiladas she said well I lied they were so good I ate them all. We all finished all around on trays what we didn't get the Finish was a second round of guacamole which was fine because I brought that home with me because for $14.50 I was going to eat it eventually. We decided to have an impromptu photo shoot and the staff was so great they took pictures for as they jumped in a couple of pictures and we just had the best time. I would recommend Rosa Mexicano to anybody who's coming in and wants an upscale Mexican food experience. Oh I forgot one of my friends and I do not drink but we didn't want to be excluded when two of my friends ordered alcoholic drinks so we had mocktails we had their pomegranate Margaritas without alcohol and it was so good.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f50457fe197e8b:0x941926c8cae87aae"}

I told him that would have been nice 20 mins ago and I would like to see the mgr.. he went back to get the manager and a few mins later the waiter and another guy who I belive was the manager came out. The waiter returned to tell me that mark will not be able to come see me, I asked him was that mark who he was talking to the waiter just looked and stumbled over his words and said yes. I told them that this was ridiculous how they run Thierry business and the waiter replied \"well you can always go ssomewhere else\". I was so mad that I experienced this kind of service I got the home office number to call corporate all I got was a voicemail an no response it is now day 2 and still no word.

She then leaves and go gets another towel. All the while there's spilled mimosa trickling down on everyone's feet. We had to ask for refills every single time, not once did she bring them on her own. When I had a problem with my food, she didn't apologize, offer to speak with the kitchen, offer something else, or offer to bring the manager. She just said \"yeah\" and nothing else. There were 2 other parties in the restaurant yet somehow the food took an hour to come out and the waitress would disappear for 20 minutes at a time.\n\nThe food was way overpriced and sub-par. Nothing seemed fresh or Hawaiian. The macaroni salad had no seasonings or vegetables in it, just noodles and mayonnaise. The breakfast sandwiches were burned. The so called big kahuna burger was as small as a McDonald's burger and over cooked. It had been sitting in the kitchen so long, the bottom bun had disintegrated by the time it got to the table. The turkey bacon was undercooked and inedible. They used American cheese on everything and didn't even bother to mix it in the scrambled eggs. It was just sitting on top like they do at Waffle House (for a tenth of the price.)\n\nThe bottomless mimosas are just bottomless orange juice served on ice.

The food was overcooked and insanely greasy.top it off with NO SEASONING!!!!( how do you make Hawaiian  food with no seasoning.) The macaroni salad is not as advertised and just mayo and noodles. The mimosas aren't even orange juice its frozen tang stuff with a splash of 5.99 champagne . Drinks are over priced and food is insanely priced for the portions and quality it comes with.

This place is a spectacle- lots of decorations and smoke\/fog machines. It looks so fun and cute!  I was disappointed in both their drink menu and food menu.\n\nTiki drinks range from like 12-18$. I got the 'not a princess' and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really worth the money. It was very sweet and you couldn't taste all the ingredients. My buddy got the 'sling'. It was YUCKY. It either wasn't mixed right- all you tasted were the bitters- or the recipe is bad. We did not stay long enough to have a 2nd drink.\n\nFood is hard to review fully as I am a vegetarian, but they didn't have one entree that didn't have meat. They had one appetizer, 2-3 salads, and some sides. The hawaiian macaroni salad is not special and totally not worth it. The tofu musubi was very tasty!\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't go back there.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f506a066e40001:0x8b20339ff4ab4f6a"}

Charge the same rates for hookah since that's the biggest seller. The existing practices will not ppl to come. People will continue to go out in the city instead.

Seriously, just sit back and watch how your employees act when interacting with customers, follow them around and watch what they do, especially while busy. Saw so many times where \"busy\" waiters were just hanging out and cutting up while people were waiting to be seen. Go around and ask the customers and they will let you know how they feel.

The bowls are much smaller and aren't even filled all the way, and they're still somehow more expensive than the other restaurants. On top of that, the quality of the food is much worse than other locations and they arent careful about safety precautions for covid. There were people in the restaurant without masks, the person scooping our protein wasnt wearing gloves, and the other person helping us didnt change gloves between serving our food and checking the person in front of us out.","resp":{"time":1594173151095,"text":"Thanks for your feedback Matt. We use biodegradable plant-base bowls which are actually larger (and deeper) than ones in other locations. Our \"create your own\" bowl is built exactly the way our customers order. We have \"signature\" bowls on our delivery platforms and are working on introducing it to in-store customers.\n\nOur employees are trained to \"double glove\" since we mix the proteins and vegetable mix-ins by hand. At a minimum, we make sure to put on a fresh glove when mixing the ingredients. However, your feedback matters to us so we will look into this and work to improve the process as much as we can. We thank you for your feedback.\n\nEdit: Thanks for your feedback again. We have looked into your feedback and improved many of the processes: 1) implemented employee training regarding health and safety, 2) added plexiglass on top of the sneeze guard for additional protection, 3) customers are asked to wear masks when entering the store, 4) POS system repositioned so that the customers carry-out the transaction (no contact with employees) and much more. Again, we value your feedback and thank you for bringing it to our attention so that we can work to improve our processes for the health and safety of our employees and customers.

The waitress dropped my check off at the table a couple minutes after I started eating (which isn't really a problem) but then came by a few minutes later asking me where my payment was. I clearly hadn't even gotten through several bites of my food. I nonetheless gave her my credit card so she could process the payment. She dropped the check back off to me and then came by TWICE again while I was clearly eating to see if I'd signed. I could understand this behavior a bit more if it were right before closing but this wasn't the case.

I got a message telling me to leave my name and number and someone would call me right back. I left a very clear message including my phone number very slowly and clearly. I called numerous times and got the same message over and over. After 9 AM and no return call I decided to drive to the bakery. When I arrived I explained the problem trying to place an order. I was told we are NOT taking any orders online today. I said, it would be nice if the website stated this which it did not. I also mentioned calling and receiving no return call and I was told we are not answering any calls until after Thanksgiving. I mentioned it would be good to change the message explaining messages would not be returned until after Thanksgiving. I asked them what was popular and tasty among their cake offerings. I was told the Key Lime Cake is very good so I purchased a 10\" 4 layer Key Lime Cake. At this point it gets really disappointing. The cake itself was tasteless! All the flavor is in the icing which was tasty. The cake was dry and the edges were actually a little crunchy - Over baked - Ugh. Needless to say, I am shocked at all of the good ratings for this bakery. VERY DISAPPOINTING! The cake was $45.74 and I won't be back.

I plan to purchase another in the nearest future, if you are looking for a cake that will leave your guests in awe, I recommend purchasing a cake from Metrotainment Bakery<3\n\nX0","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f50529f5f40aa3:0x97f3aabe0d2a3b52"}

Metrotainment does a great job at balancing flavors - some places go too hard on the sugar. Speaking of sugar... this place is totally reasonable with the icing. I don't like piled high, swirled to the ceiling icing.

It then took about 20 more minutes to receive our food, but at about this time, the restaurant was closing, the dj had finished up and staff were cleaning up so we were sitting there eating in an empty restaurant because of a mistake by our waitress.\n\nAs far as the food goes, the lemon pepper wings were very good and I ordered an \u201cAmerican mule\u201d which I enjoyed. The lobster Mac was mediocre and I expected more Mac and cheese for $18. I also ordered a shot of tequila which cost over $11... overall the food is okay, but I feel it is overpriced and the service sucked. I would have never received any food if I had not asked the cook about my order.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f503f4e6278e29:0xed627bb791ea610d"}

I went to the bar downstairs which was under construction just to be sure and asked if they had the vegan wings. There was a man and woman downstairs who yelled out \"UH UNH\" before I could ask. I'm assuming they were frustrated that I dared to enter the downstairs bar. I asked if they had vegan wings they told me I could order upstairs. Upstairs we went. Where we were told they didn't have vegan wings. Went downstairs immediately and asked for a refund. The lady at the door refused and then when we spoke with the manager she said that she never spoke with us and never  told us anything. I let them know that it is bad business to do what they are doing and bad reviews are not worth the trouble and that I would be writing one about my experience. The owner said they could care less about reviews people give them bad reviews all the time. Then the lady that took the money said to us \"This is why I don't like n*gg@s they always come around starting mess\". Apparently asking for a refund because we did not get what we paid for is starting mess. Very unfortunate experience. These reviews they received are for a reason, they are well earned.

They didn\u2019t present well, or taste that great. I won\u2019t order again. But i will definitely return for the fish.

A few minutes later I receive a notification from Doordash stating that my order was cancelled because the store is closed.\n\nNow I have a pending hold on my account for a meal that I never received and will have to wait until the pending hold drops.

I went at a good time of the day when they were slow and I was able to get in and get out.\n\nThe vibe was real chill and laid back. They have a nice setup and music playing while you\u2019re waiting or eating. The restaurant was very clean and the staff wore mask and had hand sanitizer available.\n\nThe food made up for the cashiers bad customer service. Not sure if she was having a bad day but she definitely wasn\u2019t welcoming when I first walked in.\n\nI ordered 2 piece whiting fried fish(mild flavor) combo with 2 pieces of bread and seasoned fries for $12. The fish was fried to perfection and seasoned sooo good. It\u2019s cooked to order so prepare to wait. They have other options on the menu that I can\u2019t wait to o back and try like the fried lobster tail.\n\nTheir in a location where you can miss the restaurant if you\u2019re not familiar with the area and not using your gps.

{"user_id":1.001828214e+20,"name":"Shenequa Notliketheothers","rating":2,"text":"Only reason this is getting two stars is because of how unprofessional the customer service was. I decided since I was making my way to Grady I would treat my family to something we\u2019ve been dying to try. Well first off, don\u2019t create an app and not have everything you have to offer on there. I ordered 4 Chicken and Waffle platters and ordered an side of Fries. After given the option of curbside I then get a call they don\u2019t offer. Cool! So I head to pick my order up to look at the menu that offers about ten or twelve more items that wasn\u2019t offered on the app. I questioned that! Drink machine down, now knowing they have dessert they had no dessert available. I didn\u2019t let it bother me. After, I mentioned that the fish Whitening stated it wasn\u2019t available a young lady named Herva asked someone about it and that\u2019s when a very blunt guy named Jeremy wanted to say they had it. Now I\u2019m getting more confused because I\u2019m like no drink, no dessert, app menu messed up and now your mentioning one thing after it was stated another. Like another lady mentioned after waiting for my order that went from 4 to about 10 minutes for it to be done, I finally get an incomplete order. Now help me understand this?!. You have someone who already drove an hour out to wait from 15 to 20 to now about 30 for missing items. I was aggravated so I tried to work things out by saying okay well I\u2019ll sacrifice so my children can eat. I asked the guy Jeremy who didn\u2019t really seemed as if he cared (check the cameras) that I was missing an whole meal but asked since I\u2019m giving my children what\u2019s prepared and the fries and waffles from my order will be going to my spouse could you please make MY chicken that sweated in the box as they wanted me to wait even longer, the waffle with no powder even tho I stated powder on it and my fries that look extra fried over with my missing meal and we\u2019ll call it even. Even though they messed up my order I\u2019m giving the benefit of the doubt. Herva does everything to make me pleased Jeremy tells me that even though they messed my order up I would have to wait after they just claimed they had a plate for me an additional 14 minutes for what they missed then tells me take it or leave it. Okay!! So since Jeremy wasn\u2019t trying to be understanding even though again they messed up my order I figured again if your making me wait make my food as I asked. He mentions as if he doesn\u2019t understand when I say I want my chicken hot, that it was as he opened my chicken which now looks burnt and wet because it\u2019s been sweating. With that being said since he couldn\u2019t just replace the one meal out of the fact I am still working with him and give me my missing meal that was owed which would total a 10 dollar meal that would have to be discarded but because you wanted to tell me it\u2019s whatever I bought every bag back and asked for my 50 back. Crazy! You messed my order up and then wanna be very inconsiderate and tell me to do what you say or it\u2019s no way. Jeremy shakes his  head as I walk in because now he\u2019s in charge so he\u2019s wasted food. That wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault but the customer service from Jeremy and not any other employee. Towards the end, I thanked Herva which was very apologetic and seemed genuine about it. I mentioned to HERVA I would let everyone know how phenomenal her service was compared to the gentlemen that came out the same open kitchen everyone mentioned and thought he was gonna tell me to take it or leave it. Moral of the story.... I left 50 dollars worth of food and I hope the homeless enjoy. Y\u2019all make sure when visiting have patience and sad to say don\u2019t order nothing big. Apparently even when they\u2019re at fault it\u2019s cool to give a unhappy customer the I don\u2019t care attitude when all she was trying to do is get what she paid for. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f503896fa887f7:0xb20f79ee64f47c1a"}

The Korean FC was amazing!! As a southerner, I love my fried chicken and the chef here has made a delicious fusion of a southern favorite with Korean spices. It's amazing.\n\nThe Chicken Kalguksu is a broth. If my memory serves me well, it had egg noodles and bits of chicken. The broth had a great aroma and warmed you from the inside out.

I had the Gogi Goon Mandu (seared dumplings with ground local beef, shitake, chive),  (1) Kimchi Deviled Egg, Chicken Kalguksu (overnight broth, egg crepe, nori) and an order of the Korean Fried Chicken wings.  Of all my food choices I truly enjoyed the wings.  The flavor was spot on delicious.  I did not care for the Chicken Kalguksu.  I took it home and had it for lunch after I reinvented the flavors to my liking.\n\nOne friend ordered the Bibimbop (kimchi rice, local greens, organic tofu, shiitake, 7 min egg) and Kimchi Miso Kale.  He enjoyed both his dishes tremendously.  My other friend ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with a side of fried sweet potato fries.  The hotness on this sandwich is insane.  He took two bites and gave up.  I am a heat fanatic.  I happily finished his bitten half.  The chicken did not have any flavor outside the heat, but the heat was the bomb.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Sundae Su and the Tropical Su.  Both desserts were delicious.  With every bite, there was a different taste.  The Sundae Su is a chocolate paradise and the Tropical Su is a fruit lovers paradise.\n\nI am going back for the Sundae Su very soon.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f507ac95ad7921:0x4f278eade461972c"}

Parking is easy, and they have a very nice patio with individual tables and community spaces.  The service is consistently slow, which is surprising for such a small space.  Both groups of people I went with had the same observation.\n\nWe've had more success with the appetizer items.  I would absolutely recommend trying one (or two!) of the Kimchi deviled eggs.  We were scraping every bite off of the plate.  The Smoked Pork Belly Bossam is amazing, and also fun to eat (served with lettuce leaves so you can make a wrap with all the components on the plate).  The Korean fire wings were AMAZING-- crispy and sweet.  The Gogi Goon Mandu dumplings were fairly generic and not too bad with the dipping sauce on the side.\n\nEntrees: I tried the Shrimp and Rice Grits-- this version was a bit too sweet for me with the citrus glaze, and the consistency felt too sticky.  We also sampled the Bibimbop.  It is not served in the typical hot stone bowl, and the flavor profile was a little confusing and too sweet as well.

Unfiltered, hoppy & fresh tasting!  Good start!  Salad is average, nothing wrong with it but nothing special. Next the pizza...\nA home run in my book,  good crust tasty toppings. I'll be back!\n\nLocated where Everybody's Pizza was. My wife and I have been eating at this location for years so we had to try the new owners offerings. We had our usual salad followed by a pizza. The Greek style salad was presented with all the ingredients sitting separately on the plate, strange. Dressing was OK but nothing special, greens were fresh enough. The pizza, a thin tasty crust with good toppings and in my opinion better than what Everybody's offered. They have a decent beer offering and I was told they intend to start brewing sometime next year.\n\nLastly the service and the reason for only 3 stars. Inattentive, and slow although friendly. The restaurant wasn't half full so I can't imagine going there when they are busy. At one point the waitress apologized explaining they were \"Having a meeting in the back\". Earlier that day I read a review on Yelp that contained the same statement. They need to come up with some fresh excuses.\nWhen our bill finally arrived there was an \"unidentified charge\" of $5.99. The waitress told my wife it was a mistake and it was removed but it topped off our bad experience and we left with an attitude.\nI eat out often and realize occasional bad service comes with the territory and if we went back we could have a totally different experience. I'd love to go back when they start brewing but I'm afraid my wife won't have any part of it.

Never crowded especially now, so I hope this small business can sustain dining in with strict social distancing measures. The tiny whole grain croissants are very good except cold; they could be warmed to go with the soups offered.\nI prefer the vegan\/vegetarian options for added protein  and with a cup of warm soup a person could have a fine meal for less than $10. That\u2019s a great option for health and wellness that actually tastes goooooood. Five stars when this Covid 19 is  handled better by the general public!

When I asked for extra pepper jack, he\/she ignored my request. When he\/s he claimed that they could not hear me, I deepend my tone and spoke louder. I was attempting to be heard, but I guessed she\/he took it the wrong way. She\/he began to talk negatively behind the counter about us and our orders. She stated that we were doing to much simply for asking for features that Subway offers ( toasted sandwiches, extra cheese, chip choices (kept behind the counter now)). Our order came to $41.45. They fixed all of our food and then exclaimed that they could not take anything over a $50 unless your food was over $50. At this point, it was clearly stated again that we were \"doing too much\". My friend begged them to take the money, and even explained to them that they should not throw away $41 worth of food because of a bill exchange. He asked for a manager and wasn't given any information. We left the store and left the food fixed on the counter.

The wait was a little longer than expected but the quality of the bowl explains the wait. Maybe  having an extra employee (only saw 2 employees) would help. The consistency of the a\u00e7a\u00ed pur\u00e9e was perfect! Not too frozen but not liquified. The fruits were fresh, and the granola? The granola completed the bowl. The quality of the granola that Vitality Bowl uses is the best. I have yet to find it in grocery stores. The sweetness was the perfect level. We wish a location was available near Buford, GA!

The food wasn't good at all it was also very salty. I've gotten better Chinese food from a regular take out place. Plus their prices were too high.

The 4 stars are warranted due to the size of the claws, and the deviled eggs being advertised as including shrimp, crab, and lobster meat.

I was also told no $4 drinks were available until tomorrow, only $10 drinks available.  Lastly, I wanted a bottle of the butter sauce.  You guessed it...also not available until tonight or tomorrow.  Note to self never visit on a Sunday again. My order was disappointing. Only one crab cluster, two whole Idaho size potatoes, 2 small ears of corn and I had a beef sausage added. Everything in the bowl was swimming in runny butter and there was some brown sugar crunch seasoning sprinkled all over the food. Completely unexpected.

I arrived, I ordered the Shrimp lover, but I was told they were out of shrimp...and potatoes. Considering this is a crab boil place, I don't understand how they could run out, but whatever. I ordered the crab lover instead. I asked for a lemonade only to be informed that they were out of lemonade....and every other beverage except a few bottles of water in the fridge! So I got my crab. It wasn't super expensive, and it was about a pound. Slightly over-cooked, but not horrible. I will attribute that to the pre-made plates they were serving and keeping hot. I was super hungry,\nso didn't argue the issue. My overall review is I would love to give them another try, but I am not sure if they will be prepared. I will add that this past weekend brought many visitors to ATL, so possibly this is why they were out of food? But that's all I got.

{"user_id":1.120371407e+20,"name":"Solomon Hilliard","rating":4,"text":"Good BBQ, brisket is juicy. Pork ribs are fall of the bone tender, you can even eat (some) of the bones if you like. Chicken is chopped not pulled and only slightly above average. Sides are okay, but overpriced. My favorite is the creamed corn (more like cheesed corn). They generally are very quick, sides are portioned out before hand and usually you get your food within minutes.\n\nI believe this is the most expensive BBQ in the city (beating out previous champion Lake and Oak BBQ), mainly due to it's a la carte menu. Rack of pork ribs and two sides is roughly $42 dollars before tip. That's $10 dollars more expensive than a comparable meal from Fox Bros.\n\nOverall it is cool to see the old Harp Transmission space finally be used but expense prevents this from becoming a staple.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f5033f7a552f01:0x1d63b058c2da8239"}

{"user_id":1.178461048e+20,"name":"Jacque","rating":1,"text":"I tried Bankhead Seafood Truck today located at the Trap Museum parking lot. Alot of surprising moments here. 1st Surprise: $10 parking fee to get a togo plate from a food truck, (parking decks\/lots allow 20-30 minute free parking). My overall stay from parking and leaving was exactly 10 minutes and most of that was reading the menu and asking questions about the menu. 2nd surprise: They only sell Pollock Fish..( hmmm, a Black Own Atlanta seafood resturant only sell one type of fish, the most cheapest driest and flakiest fish of the entire species...Pollock). Okay. Definitely regretting leaving the house for Pollock. McDonald\u2019s fish sandwiches is made out of Pollock. 3rd Surprise: $1 for Miracle whip with a couple of specs of relish in which they call Tarter Sauce. (Wait.. why is a seafood resturant charging for condiment). Smh. 4th surprise: Bankhead Platter..( plate were not hot enough to be consider cook to order) Who approved the recipes for this and what were they drinking or smoking during the taste study. Fish had no flavor and in the best of Pollock fashion; dry, Shrimp was cook well so that was pretty decent, nothing special about the fries ( frozen bag), hush puppies was a bit too dry and had corn ( nothing  more to say), Cole slaw was soo hot the top of the container had melt upwards.

In the past order the shrimp fried rice container but asked the owner \"why are you the only restaurant of your kind that does not sell lg, med, sm boxes of rice\". In stead, you sell this hugh container of rice with only seven shrimp and charge ($12). Money is not the issue... it's simply too much for lunch and who wants to reheat for dinner. Especially when there is no more shrimp... you only put seven in the container.\n\nLast week I noticed a kids shrimp fried rice. I asked for the kids shrimp fried rice ($5.99) and an order of spring rolls ($2.99). The owner refused and stated \"I lose money\"! He repeated loudly while I stand in shock. I asked \"so you'd rather take zero dollars than the nine that I would pay for the two items\". Again he says \"I lose money when you buy kids\"! I stated \"when I walk out of the door and let all of my University and CDC co-workers know about this you are going to really lose money if you do not sell them the kids shrimp fried rice.\n\nIf there is an item on your menu, I should be able to purchase it if I have the money to do so. You can not dictate what people can buy from your restaurant if it is on your menu and open to the public. Oh! and I forgot to mention, I asked \"what if I actually had a child in my car! The owner stated, still can't buy.\n\nI will never shop your store again!

I also got their version of egg drop soup with crab and quail eggs.\n\nFirst off... the Shaking Beef banh mi is something you have to chew slowly as the beef melts in your mouth and the flavors explode every so nicely.\n\nThe Classic banh mi is filled with so much goodness that you won't know what you have, but your tastebuds are incredibly happy. The meats are perfect, the size of the pickled veggies are just right, and that meatball is an \"excuse me, what\" deliciousness.\n\nThe BBQ classic is also just as good - you can't get any better than perfectly BBQd meat than this one.\n\nOff to the races! The egg drop soup with crab and quail eggs has now ruined me on any kind of egg drop soup. The base was not too thick, had plenty of crab in it, great cilantro that was still crunchy, and the big pearls of PERFECTLY soft boiled quail eggs.\n\nI will give this place 10 stars if I could. Amazing flavor, great prices, and you get way more than you would ever think that you paid for.","resp":{"time":1592771785526,"text":"Thank you for your kind words Rebecca!

{"user_id":1.071950882e+20,"name":"Karen Fleming","rating":1,"text":"A week ago my review would have been different. This store is a little out of my way, but I've found it worth making the trip. I came to shop for some time before trying out the salad bar. The chicken salad on the bar rivals the best and I planned on making it there more often with my recent refocus on healthier eating. The store is well stocked with mostly friendly employees. Last time I ate here I watched HGTV and lingered a bit to see the end of a show I hadn't seen in a long time. I thought I might again. Today it was set to Fox news though. I was the only viewer for an early lunch and I decided to step outside my comfort zone and request a change. I walked over to an employee and said \"Hi, last time I was here, HGTV was showing and I was wondering if we could watch something other than Fox News?\" She said \"No. It's because we like to know what's going on in the world and we like it to be the Truth.\" I don't think she actually intended to talk down to me, but I'm pretty sure she meant the Truth with a capital T. This employee left the area and was not in viewing, nor listening range for the remainder of my visit and other employees only walked through the lunch seating quickly without paying attention.\n\nIn the trade off between enjoying the food and not enjoying being made to listen to biased paternal, political persuasion, the negatives just got bigger and the likelihood of a return visit just dropped significantly.","resp":{"time":1535664494502,"text":"Karen, thanks for taking the time to fill out the detailed review.

{"user_id":1.051942976e+20,"name":"S B","rating":1,"text":"To begin, I have been a loyal customer of Goodness Groceries for the past 10 years. I live in Historic College Park (Woodward Academy Community) so if anyone knows where this is, you know it's a drive from my residence to this store(22 mi. to be exact one way). I've been to a few seminars, the 10 year celebration, purchased many supplements and oils, purchased food\/bottled water, purchased and filled water jugs continuously, had my feet, family members and many friends feet detoxed over the years.  Ms. Sue has known my 8 year old daughter since she was an infant. She suggested her first set of vitamins to me when she was only 1. Ms. Sue and Ms. Karen has always been helpful and informative about the merchandise sold in the store.\nTo began with the first incident which should have kept me from coming back occurred last year with Ms. Karen, the lady with the locs. I entered the store with my two 5-gallon jugs along with my one 3-gallon jug to fill with water. I took the first 5 gallon jug out and added about 4oz of alkaline water to the bottle and gently rinsed it then began to fill it up.  When I got to the 2nd bottle, a loud voice stated: DON'T DO THAT, THAT'S NOT WHAT THE ALKALINE WATER IS FOR, THAT'S THE REASON THE PRICES HAVE GONE UP BECAUSE YOU ALL WANT TO RINSE YOUR BOTTLES OUT WITH THE ALKALINE WATER. ITS ACID WATER RUNNING OVER INTO A CONTAINER AND THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO USE TO CLEAN YOUR BOTTLES OR CLEAN THEM BEFORE YOU COME. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO RINSE WITH THE WATER, IT'S FOR SALE. I looked at Ms. Karen  and stated o.k. I filled the rest of my jugs, paid, and left the store. I couldn't believe Ms. Karen approached me in that manner and in that tone. She was very unprofessional and appeared to be very agitated. Rules are rules and since it's been brought to my attention, I will have my bottles rinsed prior to filling them up.\nA couple of times in the past Ms. Sue's husband has helped me to my truck and placed the waters securely in the truck for me.  He is the one to inform me to use the seat belts on the waters to keep them from falling. Well a couple of months ago, I was in the store filling the same three jugs with water, already rinsed. Ms. Sue was standing in the area making smoothies and talking to me as I filled the jugs asking about Reese as she normally does. There were two young guys (appeared to be 20-25) standing behind the register as my jugs were being filled. I decided to go ahead and pay for the water prior to the jugs being filled as I have done so many times in the past. I made my purchase then went back over to complete filling the jugs.Once the jugs were done, one of the young guys at the register stated I can help you take those jugs to your car and I stated, Great. Ms. Sue informed the young guy, \"WE DON'T CARRY WATER JUGS FOR CUSTOMERS\".The young guy stated, I don't mind. She then turned to me and asked, \"DO YOU HAVE A DISABILITY WHY YOU CAN'T CARRY THEM\" I stated to Ms. Sue, no but I probably will after carrying these water bottles. She then stated, we don't carry water out unless you have a disability. I stated to her, I didn't ask him to carry the water, he volunteered, because it's not really busy. I was very offended she asked me this and as I left the store the young guy followed me and stated, I will help you. He assisted me with putting the jugs in the truck. Sue (lost respect for the Ms.) was very unprofessional, offensive and just plain rude. I want her to know that all disabilities are not physical and you should never ask a question like this if you are in a position to assist with a purchase in your store.  I have since found two stores, Whole Foods and the Vitamin Lady. The Vitamin Lady's Alkaline water is a PH of 10 and it is so fresh and quenching to the body. My numbers have gone completely down with my BP. Nothing less than professionalism is accepted at Whole Foods. I have encouraged all my co-workers, friends, and family members not to patronize this store.I pray God continue to bless her and her business. They definitely need some interpersonal skills trng.","resp":{"time":1567531640015,"text":"Stephanie, Thank you for relaying your experience and bringing this to our attention.

Tucked in a small shopping center off N Decatur Rd, we venture in after doing some serious maneuvers to park.  Seven Hens is not huge in size but it has character.  We were pleasantly greeted and proceeded to order the Indian and Mexican schnitzel on a baguette.  Once the ordered was ready, it was visually appealing, but unfortunately, looks can be deceiving.  When you have a sandwich with sauce, you need a certain kind of bread to soak up the flavors without getting soggy. I think if the chicken was seasoned and marinated to distinguish the different flavors before frying; the taste would be better than throwing a flavored seasoning on it after it is cooked.  I did not care for the Indian schnitzel, but the Mexican schnitzel was decent.  The fries were good.  I don't care to eat at an establishment when I think I could have made this so much better at home and this was the case with Seven Hens.  Our dinner was not worth the drive or the time, but they seem to have a steady stream of customers.  Most of the reviews I saw were favorable.  Seven Hens did not please my taste buds, but that does not make them a bad restaurant.\n\nI gave 3 stars because the customer service made up for the distasteful schnitzels.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f50704f0712f4f:0xb7d8815f01602fff"}

{"user_id":1.128358439e+20,"name":"Michael R","rating":3,"text":"So this is my second review for Seven Hens, the first being filtered by GrubHub on their site.\n\nToday, I ordered delivery from GrubHub. Seven hens is not far from my place, about a mile.\n\nI ordered a cajun BBQ platter with fries, \"fruit cup\", and a side salad. I had to order the side salad because they price the items so you can't enjoy a meal for one person. I received a call from GrubHub later saying that Seven Hens was out of side salad and I would have to replace the item to complete the minimum to order. I chose a coke because there was no other sides to choose from I wanted. The customer service rep did not know how much the coke was and neither did I as it wasn't listed on Seven Hen's menu. It couldn't be $2.50, though, and I had to call GrubHub later to change it from the price of the salad to the price of the coke.\n\nThe delivery was fast, approximately 15 minutes. The delivery guy brought napkins, ketchup, a straw, and a fork, everything I needed to eat. Good job, delivery guy.\n\nThe chicken was great. I loved the flavor. However, as I read in a previous review, there is little chicken there to enjoy. Next time I will have to get an extra piece. I put on the bbq and mayo sauce and it was delicious. I didn't eat the small cole slaw because I'm not a fan of cole slaw. The fries were also good; they were fresh, crisp, lightly salted. However, they also just gave me a literal handful of fries. The main complaint I have is on the \"fruit cup.\" It was literally a cup of just grapes. I understand the literal meaning of grapes being a fruit and they are in a cup, but I was expecting somr strawberries, bananas, melon, some variety. Just call it a cup of grapes. The worst part about it, though, was the grapes were not washed. They had residue all over them. Also, they were not checked for quality. Most of the grapes were covered in pock holes from where the bugs had eaten them prior to being picked. The coke also was 3\/4 of the way filled and 3\/4s of that 3\/4s was mainly ice. There was less than a can of soda in there.\n\nSo overall:\n\nPros\n-good chicken and fries\n-fast delivery\n-delivery person added all necessary materials\n\nCons\n-\"fruit cup\" was just grapes that weren't washed and not checked for quality.\n-soda needs proper fill\n- ran out of salad\n- they need to convey all items and their prices to GrubHub\n\nEdit for the owner:\n\nThank you for the reply.  I can email you exactly as I saw on the GrubHub menu to show you what I saw if you want. They called it a fruit cup  on their online menu and it was one of the only 2 options when ordering the cajun bbq platter. It sounds like there is a communication error between your two companies. I also took photos of the meal as well, so if you want you can see exactly what I was talking about with the grapes.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f50704f0712f4f:0xb7d8815f01602fff"}

On my list of culinary experiences to try, was a banh mi sandwich.  Pho Nam, a local Krog Street Market eatery, grabbed my attention with a picture that advertised an authentic banh mi sandwich, similar to many seen on television and YouTube.  I stopped, place my order, and waited an unusually uncomfortable length of time.  Meanwhile, a crowd began to collect in the Krog Street Market hallway, ignoring all social distancing norms...by the time I got my sandwich, it was a disappointment.  The french baguette was good, the pork was ground, the vegetables were missing in action, and the pate never made the trip to the bun.  I ate it knowing that my first Banh Mi Sandwich experience would be a life long sad experience.  I stretched a bit to rate my experience a 3 star...on my next visit, I might try the pho....","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f503106908a49f:0x8c21abd0724b9eef"}

It is sad that the food is amazingly awesome: pizza, wings, fries and great combo deals but the service I received today out weighted the great food. I am not sure if Bianca is the manager or the store owner but her attitude is very disgusting.\n\nI went into pizza Bella with a coworker after placing several orders online I realized I placed an additional order in error. I advised Bianca of my error and apologized. Bianca greeted me rudely with several sighs and eye rolling and yelled to the young lady in the back preparing the wings to stop and not sauce anything and repeatedly asked so you want to cancel everything after being told NO several times just the  one additional error order. The young lady I believe she said her name was Margie or Margaret came to the front and politely and ever so sweetly asked what was the problem.  I explained my error and she said no problem I haven't sauced them yet the original order is already done with a smile. The young lady was very professional and sweet.

I was hanging with some friends and we had a taste for some Jamaican food and we were in the area and I suggested Silver Delight.  This is a collective review of all my visits.  I normally ordered oxtails in the past with oxtail gravy for my rice and peas with cabbage and fried plantains. I was never disappointed.  Everything was always seasoned with great balance in flavors.  They make all their juices and pineapple ginger is my favorite when it is available.  During this particular visit, we all wanted wings.  Upon reading over the menu, we spotted Jerk and BBQ wings with fries and lemonade\/tea for $7.99, but our excitement was quickly shattered when we were informed that they were out of wings.  We debated leaving but our server convinced us to stay and my party of four we ordered the Jerk Chicken plate (jerk chicken, rice, cabbage and fried plantains).  Once again everything was seasoned well but a few of my pieces were dry but flavorful.  Thanks goodness for the side of jerk sauce to dip.  We had lemonade to drink and it was so good, but it did not look like lemonade (favored a tea & lemonade mix).  They make the lemonade in-house as well.  If you need a Jamaican fix in the Atlanta area, this is a sure win even if they don't have everything on the menu.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f51d5410758663:0x83634ac228f5a1a8"}

I intially started off wity the carrot cake. It was very good. Not overly sweet and definitely not dry.\n\nThe next time they came I decided to get the Jerk Chicken, rice and peas and cabbage. I felt like I wasted my money. The portions were skimpy for the money they charging. They give you a dab of rice and a dab of cabbage. It doesn't even fill the space in the plate. The chicken was excessively dry and overcooked not to mention so hot I couldn't really taste the flavor of the jerk seasoning. The cabbage was raw. Please stop serving raw cabbage. It is not coleslaw. And whatever you do put a decent amount of food on the plate. You guys come once a week yet you still hold back on the portions.\n\nFurthermore I live 2 miles from your restaurant and would love to be a regular because you are in my community and you are black owned but not if I'm not getting my money's worth. Just food for thought. I would love to try your food again and brag about it. Many employees complain about the same thing.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f51d5410758663:0x83634ac228f5a1a8"}

I couldn't help but laugh when he handed it to me.. like what? Food was still good though.\n\nOn my second visit I got a different person and the woman was very sweet and courteous over the phone. I love their hot sauce and even though I didn't express this directly, the woman was still able to tell and when I arrive to pick up my food she made sure my wings were thoroughly covered and she gave me an extra container of hot sauce for my felafel bowl\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f I just really appreciate her extra care and observation.

This is a tiny grocery store which has a taqueria connected to it located out on the edge of Atlanta and Smyrna. It's surrounded by abandoned buildings so its certainly off the grid in terms of location.\n\nOnce you get there, you'll find a menu written on the dry-erase board. They had a small but varied menu: from tacos and burritos to chicken wings and rice plates. I came here for one thing though: tacos! I ordered two kinds:\n\n1) Asada, steak (this is how I like to compare tacos)\n2) Chicharron, pork skin\n\nThe tacos were prepared authentically: double corn tortilla, cilantro, onion, lime, and salsa verde. They were pretty good; however, the tortilla was a little off. It was chewy (the stale kind of chewy) which might be because I came in a bit after typical lunch hours. The asada was flavorful but the chicharron was unbearably salty.\n\nWould I come back? If I were in the area, definitely.

They gave me huge portions of everything, added extras, and were super-friendly throughout and helped me de-stress from a long day, all within the super-quick 5 minutes it took to make my order, chat and finish up. Felt rejuvenated enough to sit in my car to finish my to-do list of the day before going home to enjoy my food.\n\nI forgot to get the names, but I believe it was one male manager and one younger guy.

{"user_id":1.113326065e+20,"name":"Quang Ngo","rating":5,"text":"Ruby Chow's is a jewel worth visiting. Offering a fusion style Asian cuisine in smaller plates, there's definitely something special about this restaurant. First heard about Ruby Chow's back in late March, but never had the chance to visit with COVID-19 looming over everything. It is safe to say that they have taken measures to provide a fantastic dining experience, while keeping safety procedures in place.\n\nFirst off is parking. You can do street parking across the street from them using the Park Mobile App. There are signs posted for the Zone to select once you've downloaded the app. Very easy to use. If there is no space, then it's only a short drive further to Ponce City Market and a 5 minute walk to the restaurant. Plenty of options in between if you're looking for something to do until it's time to eat.\n\nReservation is recommended and usually plenty of times to choose from. Was not crowded when I went on a 5:30 evening dinner reservation.\n\nSafety procedures. Expect to wear a mask from the time you come into the restaurant, until you sit down and food comes out to eat. Reception provides a small plastic bag to keep your mask in while you dine. Everyone was wearing masks and gloves when I entered. They also do thorough cleaning in between people coming in. Space is limited inside for social distancing. Bar side dining is also an option.\n\nFood was fantastic. Everything is on the smaller side portions. You could share some bites out of each dish, but it is better to be prepared and know what you'll be ordering ahead of time. Servers give great recommendations as well, if you're not too sure about what dishes to try.\n\nShoyu Tomago - I knew this would be the first dish I ordered, based on the great reviews others have left. While it was good, it left me feeling a little underwhelmed. Rice was crispy and the egg was nicely cooked on top. The sauce gave the rice a nice zesty flavor, went well with the egg. Definitely recommend to others to try.\n\nSzechuan Green Beans - A nice simple appetizer while waiting for other dishes. Glazed very nicely with sesame seeds. This is a dish you can share between two or three people.\n\nSoft-Shell BLT Bun - This comes with two buns to share or to have all to yourself. Skeptical at first when it came to the bacon with soft-shell crab, but it turned out better than expected. The bun was nice and fluffy. Give these a try or any of the other bun dishes.\n\nRoti Canai - This was the wife's favorite. Bread and curry was prepared very well. The curry has pieces of chicken. Tasted great when dipped or even with a side of white rice. Wish they gave a little more curry. Could be a shareable dish between two people, something to try together.\n\nShumai (Shrimp & Pork) - I hardly ever order shumai when I go out to eat at restaurants, but this was by far one of the better ones I've had. Perfect bite size pieces. Just the right amount of shrimp and pork with each bite. It comes with five pieces, easy to share or to have to yourself. Definitely recommend this one to try. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nPork Kimchi Rice - Personal favorite of mine. I kept looking at this dish while glancing at the menu. It sounded intriguing, I have a habit of leaning towards Korean cuisine whenever I go out. The egg, rice, sliced pork belly and Kimchi went so well together. Not spicy, but there's a nice kick in flavor when you mix everything together. This is definitely a dish that could be shared, but I could have finished it on my own as well. Must try. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nPandan Cheesecake with Passion Fruit Sauce - This beautiful dessert was recommended by the waitress as well as the owner. Once and awhile, they like to do special dishes. I wholeheartedly believe this should be a permanent item on the menu. Could be done in different variations, such as lychee or mango sauce. The cheesecake was light and fluffy, good flavor amount of pandan. If you have a chance to ever try this dessert, you won't be disappointed. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nOverall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice dinner spot. Service was immaculate and always pleasant. Thank you!","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f505f732ee75d9:0x68aeef2578c8e4fc"}

The flowery wallpaper is one of a kind and mesmerizing.\n\nThe upstairs lounge is cozy and inviting with the same Asian fusion theme throughout. This is where you come with a group of friends to relax and have a few drinks and apps after work.\n\nWe came for a soft opening so some of the items we tried may not be on the menu, but here are my thoughts. All the food was delicious. All the food is tapa style so that is something to consider. It\u2019s always nice to share.\n\nThe General Tso\u2019s Chicken (vegetarian) was amazing. I thought it was actually chicken but it was not. The Kimchi Rice was great; it was more rice than kimchi and that was okay with me. The green beans were perfectly cooked. The basil chicken is a must have at the table.

I ate there three different times and I feel like palak paneer or paneer marsala would be better than the cabbage curry or other ones they offer. Indian food is one of my favorite cuisines, but the flavors aren't really there at this place. I've been to the actual restaurant \"taste of india\" and the curries at this food court were more bland than the restaurant and there are much better indian places to eat than here, even the Tasty Bites Indian food pouches that you microwave is more flavorful. Also this place isn't cheap either, so I expected a lot better. I don't want this review to be a negative thing, they have a lot of potential to make it better and I hope they do because I won't continue coming if I can make better indian food at home for a fraction of the price or go to a different restaurant.\nAlso the taj mahal grill in Kennesaw is a really great place. Its not cheap but not super expensive,  there are buffets in the morning (cheaper option if you wanna eat alot and try new things), the people are very friendly and the food is always amazing and you get unlimited rice when you eat. In Lawrenceville, the naan and curry is a great cheaper place to eat and they have specials on certain days to save you money.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f50519d1840dc7:0x7f1d0c1e9287674c"}

The owners are wonderful people and will walk you through all their food with great detail and make suggestions based on your preferences\/allergies. They keep trying out new things and never disappoint;  the first few times I went there, my favourites were the Fried Chicken Arepa with a side of Chickpea Mash. On my recent visit, the owners recommended the sweet potatoes and the cold pasta, and both the dishes were  incredible! I don't have dietary restrictions but if you did have even the craziest ones, I'm fairly certain they'd have something for you.

{"user_id":1.168937274e+20,"name":"Becky Blades","rating":2,"text":"Website menu is awfully unclear. Against my better judgement, I tried this place site unseen, despite the discrepancies between the menu on Uber Eats and the main website  I was right to be skeptical. The chicken was very oily and upset my stomach and the small leg and thigh I received was certainly not any better than the whole organic chickens I can get at Whole Foods for nearly the same price. Also, since the menu is so painfully ill written online, I didn't realize it came with zero sides. I suspected it wouldn't, but I also wasn't 100% certain. I wasn't impressed enough to consider ever ordering from here again, but maybe it's better in person so that you can ask 100 questions about the vague menu. Things are labeled vegan, but not gluten free. In my experience, I never assume that all items on a menu are gluten free unless they are actually specified as being so individually. A clarified menu could help this business tremendously. If labeled properly, I would have been more tempted to order some of the pastry items which, depending on the quality, could have turned me into a regular customer as opposed to somebody who just got the mediocre chicken once. But it's not just the ingredients that need clarification, it's basically all of their food items. List entrees and sides separately and clearly. Maybe add a brief description of items so people have at least the slightest clue of what they are ordering aside from just chickpeas or chicken. Though I'm not motivated to try this place again, I wouldn't deter anyone else from giving it a shot. My suggestion: GO THERE IN PERSON.","resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88f5058fd1788825:0x444eb3659e2a30ef"}

I ordered the lunch special which came with two sides, cornbread, and your choice of meat (fried chicken obviously). I felt that the food was cooked nicely and not overdone. I did think the cornbread could have been a bit sweeter, but I have heard traditional southern cornbread is not actually supposed to be sweet...so I think I just have a sweet palate.  The dine in area is, as they say, no frills. There are tables and chairs, that's it really.

We were so eager to eat we forgot to pray to bless our food!  Everything we had hoped for in our meal was that and more! Portions were more than plenty. We even took home leftovers. I am so glad we decided to turn off our gps and just explore until we found somewhere new to try. We decided that when we come back we are bringing the rest of the family to enjoy moma's cooking without moma getting wore out!\nOur meals consisted of: Hamburger steak and gravy, lima beans, corn, cornbread, peach cobbler, sweet tea; Liver and onions, collards, mashed potatoes, fried okra, cornbread, and banana pudding with a cherry coke.

The first time I visited, there was a long wait, but that was a customer rather than management issue.  I can't help but notice a few bad reviews stemming from grub hub\/door dash\/Uber eats.  I am done with all those services - they started out great, but started missing items or bringing sub-par food.  The disconnect lies on the courier, from what I've seen.  At Sister's, you get large portions for your money, the staff goes above and beyond to welcome guests, and the food is SO good.  I can't emphasize that enough.

The 3 people in my party all wanted chicken. There were only 4 pieces. Rather than dropping more chicken, it wasn't gonna be dropped until after we ordered and and the sides had already been plated. I went ahead and got a vegetable plate to avoid the wait *bad choice*. The young lady behind the counter was unknowledegable about everything. When we finally got our food, to our dismay, it was HORRIBLE!!! The entire plate with the exception of the chicken the two other people in my party had was thrown away. I guess because all the vegetables were left overs. Considering we were one of the 2nd or 3rd guests, the macaroni and cheese was obviously stale. The cheese was stiff, not cheesy (stringing like mac does while warmed when scooped). We figured out the dressing tasted like it had ramen noodle packets in it for seasoning. Plus, most of the tops over the food had food on top of it. This caught my attention because the food wasn't overflowing in the pans. Needless to say, I won't be back.

So expect to pay $10-20 to park. The food is not the best. I ordered fries and my friend ordered a sampler. We were the only two in the place and the order took 20 minutes. The fries were stale as if they had been refried\/warmed. My friend said her chicken wasn't good and the shrimp has no seasoning. Drinks were decent. Ok price for happy hour.
